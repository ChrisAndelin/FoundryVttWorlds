TAKE COVER!</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Read this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;It is midday when you finally arrive at the hamlet you saw from a distance. Halflings are walking around calmly, tending for the nearby crop and all is peaceful, unlike anything you&rsquo;ve ever seen before. The low hums of the workers bring forth sweet melodies, the sun shines in the distance and, for as scary as the world normally is, now it feels awfully&hellip; serene. As you take in the scene, you begin to hear a roaring sound through the wind. You look up, only just to notice a gigantic rock flying towards you with immense speed. You hear a halfling voice, &ldquo;LOOK OUT!&rdquo;, then the people scatter. Quickly, the stone crashes in the village, burying itself into the ground and sliding forward, digging up dirt and grass. The serenity is gone. All that&rsquo;s left is a general confusion. And a few halflings eyeing the rock motionless. You then hear the same voice that shouted before come from a female halfling figure who&rsquo;s dusting herself off. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it with that bastard! It&rsquo;s the fifth time he does it this year. How many times do we have to tell him we can&rsquo;t give him food right the second he wishes for it?&rdquo; The female figure then approaches the rock and begins kicking it angrily.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Martha Highclover</p>\n<p><strong>Information:</strong>&nbsp;At first glance, Martha is but a simple villager. She seems to be in her early 40s, with a little bit of crow&rsquo;s feet around the eyes. Her hair is red and tied in a tight bun, with her freckled pale skin being mostly covered by minimalistic villager clothes. Just from her green eyes, one can tell she is a feisty one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once approached by the players, Martha will explain that about a year or so ago a giant decided to settle down quite close to the village. And they have to pay him with a lot of their food in order for him to leave them alone. She&rsquo;s quite sick of it, but there&rsquo;s nothing she can do about it. If the party could, however&hellip; She&rsquo;d repay them in kind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She&rsquo;ll ask the party to go to each small house and gather up some food, then cut off some crops and ready up a cart, then she&rsquo;ll take them to the giant, fool him with food then they&rsquo;ll attack and kill him.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She reminds the party that while not everyone might want to give food, they all have to play their part.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>1.2. Gathering Supplies</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The party must now do their best to gather food from the few people of the hamlet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Areas of the Hamlet</strong></h3>\n<h4><br /><strong>1 - Longhouse</strong></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Upon knocking on the door to the longhouse, the players will be greeted by Heidi Hartwell, a halfling woman surrounded by 7 children running around like little maniacs. The children&rsquo;s names are Horrace, Helen, Herman, Hollister, Hethia, Honia and Helia. Her husband, Haran, is currently out cutting lumber. She tries to listen to the party, but she frequently interrupts them to look after the kids. She doesn&rsquo;t seem to have even noticed what&rsquo;s going on outside.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once asked for food, she&rsquo;ll get angry and start saying she has plenty of mouths to feed already. The players will have to make a&nbsp;<strong>DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong> to calm her down. In case they fail, she&rsquo;ll throw the @Actor[u1fNOFy5sHsbHB0G]{Child}ren on them (the children consider this play, although their mother doesn't). Upon taking 1 point of damage, the children retreat. It is assumed the party is not going to use lethal weapons on the children, so the fighting should be flavored as play.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once combat has ended (or the mother is calmed down), the children will start getting very interested in the party, due to them being from out of town. They will offer to trade their daily apple for any knick-knacks the party might have. Any offer that is not distinctly toy-like must be followed by a&nbsp;<strong>DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check</strong>. After 5 apples have been acquired, the mother will sigh and say that is what they normally give anyway, thus the party has completed this side of the food gathering.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alternatively, after knocking, the party can try to intimidate the woman with a&nbsp;<strong>DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check</strong>, leading straight to the combat encounter, but then receiving 10 apples from the angry and scared mother.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>2 - Martha's Home</strong></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The slightly stumpier and smaller home has an ornate wooden sign that says&nbsp;&ldquo;The home of Sorin Shorthalt and Martha Highclover&rdquo;. The smell coming from the inside is of a tasty soup. Once the players knock, they&rsquo;ll hear a low voice asking &ldquo;Did it leave?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The players must convince Sorin it is safe to exit, with a&nbsp;<strong>DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, he&rsquo;ll then open the door. If they fail the check initially, he'll come out in due time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sorin Shorthalt<br /><strong>Information:</strong>&nbsp;He is a short and stumpy man, with a messy chef&rsquo;s apron and hair slicked back to cover a progressing bald spot. He looks a tad bit scared. Whenever speaking about food, he is as happy as one can be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;Martha and Sorin&rsquo;s house is filled with all types of spices, and vegetables hanging out to dry from the ceiling. With a smile, Sorin leads you to a large cooking pot, almost twice his size, in which a soup is boiling with an incredible smell.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once he hears out the situation, he will contemplate it for a few seconds. He&rsquo;ll then look up and say &ldquo;might as well have some fun while we&rsquo;re at it&rdquo;. He&rsquo;ll tell the players he&rsquo;ll give them one-third of the soup. However, if they guess the ingredients correctly, he&rsquo;ll give them half instead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To guess the ingredients, the players must perform three&nbsp;<strong>DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) checks</strong>. These can either be performed by one player in sequence, or by multiple players at the same time. Any character with proficiency in cook&rsquo;s utensils or the chef feat may perform this check with advantage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Upon finishing the taste test, Sorin lowers his head in sadness and kisses the soup goodbye, before handing it over. He then immediately starts making another one with an excitement few can muster.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>3 - Shed</strong></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the back, behind Martha&rsquo;s home, is a small shed with a locked door. Players can get themselves in by performing a&nbsp;<strong>DC 12 Dexterity (Thieves&rsquo; tools) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>Inside, they find drying meats and cheeses they can take. This will give each player 3 days' rations and will help them in the following chapters of the adventure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>4 - Medium House</strong></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The door to this medium-sized house seems to be partway opened. Inside, an older man creeks back and forth on a rocking chair, half-asleep. A large table can be spotted in the back, filled with all manner of food.</p>\n<p>Players with a passive Perception above 14 will spot a comically large hearing horn next to him.</p>\n<p>If they wish to get the food without waking him, they must make a&nbsp;<strong>DC 11 Dexterity (Stealth) check</strong>. In case they do wake him, the old mind is both blind and mostly deaf. He will ask if they&rsquo;ve returned from getting crops, but won&rsquo;t bother them too much.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>5 - Crops</strong></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;A large patch of fresh wheat rests on the nearby land, undisturbed but for a few halflings tending to it. Next to it rest two additional scythes one can choose to pick and work with.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After two players grab scythes, they must trim down some wheat. This will require a&nbsp;<strong>DC 12 Strength (Athletics)</strong> check&nbsp;from each.</p>\n<p>While they are cutting down the wheat, choose 1 of the players to roll 1d4. This will determine what they find within the wheat. You can have your players roll and refer to this table or use this @Macro[PO9f79hoiQ96oN04]{Field Encounter Roll Table macro} which will automatically roll it for you while keeping the result hidden from your players.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 99.1477%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 2.17765%;\">d4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 97.5358%;\">&nbsp;Result</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 2.17765%;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 97.5358%;\">Casually munching bits of wheat are 3 @Actor[NOa35DGgWI570rAr]{Swarm of Rats}.

It&rsquo;s an ea:sy harvest.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>6 - Boulder</strong></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;As per your expectations, the boulder in front of you is large, round and has gigantic finger-like indentations in it.. You are unsure as to how far away it was thrown from, but it sure is a distance.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once the players have collected some food and crop from at least 3 sources, Martha will approach them with her cart at the ready, along with two horses. Whenever they wish, players may proceed to the next chapter.</p>","img":"worlds/size-does-matter/materials/C1C.jpg"}

Saddle Up!</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;Martha quickly helps you load up the cart and throws a cover over it. Although the food is not plentiful, it surely is enough to maybe draw the attention of some predators. One thing is for sure, you&rsquo;re going to have to be pretty careful. She quickly saddles up on one of the three horses, then turns towards you. &ldquo;The giant isn&rsquo;t far off, but the hills themselves aren&rsquo;t free of threats. Let&rsquo;s try our best to be safe.&rdquo; With that said, your short travel begins.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The journey proceeds calmly for the most part until the players make their way into a forest.</p>\n<p>On this journey, the players can make some&nbsp;<strong>DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong>. On a successful check, the players find small hunting traps made of wood and bone on the ground. If Martha is questioned about them, she&rsquo;ll tell the truth and say she&rsquo;s never seen anything like them, but they should be on their guard.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>2.2. Rest</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;Your horses lead you calmly into the forest, through a dirty, yet passable road. Martha remains silent, yet driven, looking around as best as she can. Then, you finally arrive in a small clearing, where Martha turns towards you and gets off the horse. &ldquo;We should give them a few minutes to rest before we go towards the giant.&rsquo; She then gets off the horse and begins setting up something for them to drink from, while you may observe the surrounding area.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><strong>Areas of the Clearing</strong></h3>\n<h4><br /><strong>1 - Rock</strong></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A large, jagged rock sits unassumingly in the middle of this clearing. Weirdly enough, it has some markings. A&nbsp;<strong>DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check</strong>&nbsp;will reveal these marks are the signs of wolves scratching their fur against it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>2 - Etched, Hollowed Tree</strong></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;On the edge of this clearing, you can just about make out one tree which is larger than the rest, but something about the bark looks rather odd, almost as if it extends past the point you would expect it too. Unnaturally so.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once the players approach closer, they can make a&nbsp;<strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong>. On a success, they'll find a hidden clasp and open the bark as if it were a door, revealing a stash of food, which players can also pick up for future use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>3 - Large Tree</strong></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also ever-present is another large tree, on which there is etched a heart, which writes &ldquo;A+A&rdquo;. When a player attempts to get away from this tree, they trigger a trap. They must roll a&nbsp;<strong>DC 14 Dexterity saving throw</strong> or be restrained by a rope holding them upside down on a failure. Upon triggering this trap, two @Actor[6vf3ivAHeY6g6RbN]{Bugbear} and two @Actor[p7EyWgSM333CNCdc]{Dire Wolf}s emerge from the forest, ambushing the players.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The players can use the critter bones they found earlier to distract the wolves, as they are badly trained. If a bone is thrown in their direction, they will chase after it for 2 turns before returning to combat. Martha (@Actor[2RvZq7zNnLaDDWXh]{Commoner}) will hide for the entirety of the combat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Upon reaching one-quarter of their hit points, the bugbears will shout for the violence to stop. If the players kill any of them, skip the next chapter. If the players do indeed stop, proceed normally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>2.3. Hunter Lovers</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The bugbears introduce themselves as Artishia and Arcadirim. Their dire wolves are named Zefu and Damu. They will stop fighting and will ask the party where they are going. Upon hearing of the players going to fight the giant, they will say they saw him fall asleep in the crossroads and they&rsquo;ll offer up to help poison the food they are to bring to him if they are spared.<br /><br />If the players have taken their tree stash of food they will trade the poison only for the stash, unless intimidated by a&nbsp;<strong>DC 16 Charisma (Intimidation) check</strong>.<br /><br />If both parties come to an agreement, they will poison the food and wish the players the best of luck in murdering the giant.</p>","img":"worlds/size-does-matter/materials/C2C.jpg"}

We&rsquo;ve got to tell the others. Boy, what a hearty meal we have in store for you!&rdquo; And with that, you return to the unnamed hamlet she calls home.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The players eat a good meal, are given some coin for their troubles, and may proceed invigorated, knowing they saved a small settlement from a very aggressive neighbor.</p>","img":""}
