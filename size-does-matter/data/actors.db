Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Martha","displayName":20,"img":"worlds/size-does-matter/materials/martha.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"2RvZq7zNnLaDDWXh","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+2 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

animal may present such an impact upon humanoid life as does the rat.&nbsp; Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to.&nbsp; These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves.&nbsp; Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door.&nbsp; Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant’s abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures.&nbsp; Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals.&nbsp; A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself.&nbsp; Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur.&nbsp; Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth.&nbsp; Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p><p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p><p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p><p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p><p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>"}},"sort":700000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/sundries/books/book-embossed-jewel-gold-purple.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"rjlTBnXJGxoodrM3","name":"Small Knife","type":"loot","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A blunt knife used by the scholarly to open letters and correspondence.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 151","quantity":1,"weight":0.5,"price":0.5,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"Common","identified":true,"attuned":false,"damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":4600000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-jeweled-purple.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"hAOdlcKJP3W7zD0p","name":"Artificer's Lore","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 37","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"target":{"value":"","width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":"","long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"type":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"Rock Gnome","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"featType":{"value":"passive","_deprecated":true,"type":"String","label":"Feat Type"},"time":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damageType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"attributes":{"spelldc":10},"attunement":0},"sort":5200000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description","entityorder":{"order":98}},"img":"icons/magic/fire/flame-burning-chain.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"z0AzZRlDE0RiB0Vp","name":"Gnome Cunning","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 37","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"target":{"value":"","width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":"","long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"type":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"Gnome","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"featType":{"value":"passive","_deprecated":true,"type":"String","label":"Feat Type"},"time":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damageType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"attributes":{"spelldc":10},"attunement":0},"sort":5300000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description","entityorder":{"order":141}},"img":"icons/magic/light/hand-sparks-glow-yellow.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"5hEbhdZm1ozQ3B2g","name":"Tinker","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You have proficiency with artisan's tools (tinker's tools).

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"wizard","levels":2,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"9ojqd2dejdsffabi","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"]},"value":{"added":{"0rezvlf2ul1kjm7d":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","mb3aiiyoga49hld8":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9","6xqBSaHx7rO4xNio":"","QS6T4cHGXYlR9AHa":""}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"o0xix805mucymjbt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"]},"value":{"added":{"sclzbw99jj9io4l1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"sg6rj5gth6ljcbkg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.JfFfHTeIszx1hNRx"]},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"hoi88xqc3e5je60f","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nUrZDi6QN1YjwAr6","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.31bKbWe9ZGVLEns6"]},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6x1gwvf02qraedhe","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg"},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}}},{"_id":"0rezvlf2ul1kjm7d","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.
