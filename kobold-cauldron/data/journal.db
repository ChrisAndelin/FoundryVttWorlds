Long shadows made by kobolds move along the wall. It sounds like they are whispering, shushing each other while they try to hide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once the characters enter the tunnel and get mid-way towards area 14, the kobolds in area 14 hit a button dropping iron doors from the ceiling at both ends. Next, three @Actor[oM6OxFMQo7IXvBZF]{Fire Elementals} appear, one in each alcove, and attack, taking full advantage of their fire form in the tight quarters. Thanks to the trapped heat made by the fire elementals, the hallway quickly turns into an oven. The heat starts at 150° F during the first round of combat. Then, at initiative count 20 (losing ties) the temperature of the oven increases by 50° F for each fire elemental that is still in the oven to a maximum of 550° F. As the heat increases, the oven becomes an environmental hazard for the characters. When a character ends their turn in the oven, refer to the Fire Elemental Oven table below to determine what happens.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fire Elemental Oven</strong></h3>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Temperature</th>\n<th>Save DC</th>\n<th>Heated Metal?</th>\n<th>Fire Damage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>150° - 249°</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>250° - 349°</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>350° - 449°</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>450° - 550°</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>4d8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Exhaustion DC.</strong> Each round that a character ends its turn in the fire elemental oven, it must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC of the saving throw depends on the temperature of the oven as shown on the Fire Elemental Oven table. On a failed saving throw, a character takes one level of exhaustion. Creatures that are resistant or immune to fire damage automatically pass their saving throws.</p>\n<p><strong>Heated Metal.</strong> All manufactured metal objects, such as a metal weapon or suit of heavy or medium metal armor, begin to glow red hot. A creature holding or wearing a metal object must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the current temperature's DC. If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of its next turn. The items remain heated for as long as the temperature in the oven stays above 250° F and for 2 rounds afterward. Creatures that are resistant or immune to fire damage automatically pass their saving throws.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire Damage.</strong> A creature automatically takes the amount of fire damage listed on the Fire Elemental Oven table.</p>\n<p><strong>Escaping the Oven.</strong> A character on the other side of the northernmost iron door can hit the button in area 14 to raise the iron doors. Once the iron doors are up, the temperature in the corridor decreases by 100° F each round. An iron door can be lifted with a successful DC 20 Strength check. However, the doors are extremely hot. The moment a character places their unprotected hands on one of the doors, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw the current temperature's DC or make their Strength check with disadvantage. Each door has an AC of 20 with 50 hit points (damage threshold 5) and is immune to fire, poison, and psychic damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Defeating the Fire Elementals.</strong> Once all three fire elementals are destroyed, the temperature in the oven decreases by 25° F each round until it returns to normal room temperature (a \"balmy\" 100° F).</p>\n<p><img src=\"worlds/kobold-cauldron/artwork/drakescale-area-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"443\" height=\"1445\"></p>"}

A few weeks ago, a popular new liquor called Red Claw showed up in the city's many taverns. Anyone that took even a sip of this spirit immediately wanted another taste. At first, these desires were nothing more than cravings. But soon, those cravings grew to obsession. Then obsession turned to violence. Now, the city of Knotside faces collapse as the red-eyed Red Claw addicts stalk the streets, desperate for more.</p>\n<p>Unknown to the citizens of Knotside, Red Claw is the invention of a wicked red dragon that calls itself Tuckerthranx the Agitator. Only through stopping the dragon and his kobold minions will the town of Knotside be free of this booze-fueled curse.</p>\n<h2>Running This Adventure</h2>\n<p>Clash at Kobold Cauldron is a challenging location-based adventure for four 10th-level adventurers. The adventure starts in the @Scene[SRMBYumPLCI5WpgN]{Royal City of Knotside} and leads the characters to the @Scene[foDR33JdYqztxrM0]{Red Claw Distillery} where they will encounter Tuckerthranx, an adult red dragon, and his wily horde of kobolds.</p>\n<p>While many of the encounters in the adventure are built for four 10th-level adventurers, a few are significantly more difficult, especially Tuckerthranx himself.

Of course, being such a prosperous and thriving community, it is often the target for mischief, political subterfuge, and the occasional attack from rabble-rousers, firebrands, and evil-doers. One such evil-doer recently moved into Drakescale Peak, a mountain 25 miles to the north of Knotside—an adult red dragon named Tuckerthranx the Agitator.</p>\n<p>@Actor[bLtWSRvO9Q1SmhCF]{Tuckerthranx}&nbsp;(or just \"Tucker\" for short) stands apart from his other red-scaled brethren. Driven by an insatiable desire to grow his already-stout treasure hoard, Tucker often puts his mind and cleverness before his ego and arrogance. Knowing that attacking a city as large and well-guarded as Knotside would be pure foley, Tucker instead turned his machinations towards entrepreneurialism. With the help of a plucky kobold sorcerer/brewer named Boeger, Tucker created a tasty, alcoholic beverage named, appropriately, Red Claw.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you choose not to run the adventure in&nbsp;or near Knotside, you can use any medium or larger&nbsp;lawful or lawful good city near a mountain range.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Boeger's Red Claw wasn't just a delicious, anise-flavored spirit. It also contained a special ingredient: dark magic. Any creature that drank the liquor immediately desired more. At first, the liquor's effect was subtle. Hardly anyone in Knotside noticed that they were becoming addicted to the stuff. But after a couple shots, drinkers would do anything to get another taste. Knotsiders were tossing gold, jewels, gems, anything they could to get more barrels from the dragon's delivery men.</p>\n<p>Eventually, riots broke out as the town turned towards chaos. Half of Knotside's militia tried to temper the issue and control the ravenous population. The other half were just as affected, rendered useless by their own craving for the Claw.</p>"}

Outside of teleporting directly into the courtyard, the only way for the characters to reach the other side of the lava flow is by flying or leaping over the lava... or by crossing the bridge.</p>\n<h2>General Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise stated, here are the most common features of the distillery and dragon's lair.</p>\n<p><strong>Extreme Heat</strong>. The temperatures within the distillery and caldera reach temperatures as high as 125° F, and even higher the closer the characters get to Tucker's caldera. Review the extreme heat rules in the DMG for details.</p>\n<p><strong>Lava and Magma.</strong> Lava is extremely dangerous. The first time a creature enters lava or magma, it takes [[/roll 6d10 # Fire Damage]] fire damage, and then again if it ends its turn in the lava/magma. In addition, the heat haze rising from the lava/magma lightly obscures creatures and objects on the other side of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Light.</strong> Most of the distillery is lit by the ambient light of the magma that courses through it. Still, there are many dark tunnels and chambers. Use your own discretion to determine how much light is in a given area. The descriptions assume that the characters have darkvision or other methods of seeing.</p>\n<p><strong>Spirit Barrels.</strong> The kobolds store barrels of their infamous @Item[3KLkuO1CWKjeJfcM]{Red Claw Liquor} all throughout the complex. The @Actor[A1CJSZcansKYHjSQ]{Barrels of Red Claw} are highly explosive. If one of these barrels takes fire damage, roll [[/gmroll 1d20 # Risk of barrel explosion]]. If the result on the d20 is less than the fire damage dealt, use the Eruption rules as described in the Barrel entry.</p>\n<h2>The Main Entrance</h2>\n<p>Exploration of the Red Claw Distillery begins at the @JournalEntry[l7oO7br4mSO0ghjN]{A1.

If the character is overloaded with gear, they make this check with disadvantage. On a failed check, the character is restrained by the tar on the ceiling until it breaks free.

A creature that doesn't need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk sprays its musk, it can't do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.

Characters that are stuck or sprayed by skunks are bound to alert the kobolds in area 13. Nine kobolds arrive and place a large wooden shield over the northern exit leading to area 13, barring it into place. The shield grants the kobolds 3/4 cover. From there, they attack with 15 foot long pikes. It takes three kobolds to use a pike. If the kobolds are reduced to two kobolds or less, they retreat, leaving the shield barred in place.</p>\n<p><strong>Moving the Shield Out of the Way. </strong>The bar holding the kobold's shield in place is made of soft pine. It only takes a DC 5 Strength check to burst it. If a character succeeds the check by 5 or more, they push the shield out of the way and immediately step into the @JournalEntry[sA41IxKlHsjH6LvS]{13. West Distillery}. When this happens, chicken feathers fall from the ceiling onto the character. If the character had any part of them stuck to the tar from the ceiling, the feathers automatically stick to them and remain stuck until the tar is dissolved.

If you're adventurers—and it looks like you are—then I hope you can assist us in finding the source of the Red Claw liquor, and, in turn, a way to return our citizens' sanity.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the way of a reward, Kollias doesn't have much to offer the characters at the moment. However, he promises that the city of Knotside—the remarkably wealthy city of Knotside—will be in their debt. He does mention that the Red Claw monks have hauled off massive piles of coins and gems from the Knotsiders. Were the characters to find it, they are free to keep one-quarter of it. \"The people of Knotside will see it as a 'fee' for your services, I'm sure,\" he will assure the characters.</p>\n<p>At this point, the characters probably have a few questions for Kollias. Here is what he knows about Red Claw and its creators.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What Kollias Knows</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"How does Red Claw affect the drinkers?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kollias notes that the Red Claw itself doesn't act like a poison or a disease, but instead has more in common with a curse. The available clergy in Knotside have been working to cast remove curse on the infected, but they are terribly overwhelmed. Some of the sages in town theorize that if they had the original ingredients that went into creating the Red Claw, they could devise a bulk cure for everyone in town.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Where did the monks that delivered the Red Claw go?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last time the monks came into town, they were armed. What few commoners tried to go after them were picked off by flaming arrows shot by the caravan guards. Kollias sent a scout after the monks and believes they're hiding their distillery somewhere in the Basilisk's Spine mountain range.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What did the monks look like?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kollias and his men swear that some of the monks were dragonborn. Others were short, possibly halflings. They all wore thick robes with bandages wrapped around their arms and face. Mangy-looking giant weasels pulled their carts. The guards who came with them were heavily armed and organized, but also robed, wearing red dragon masks similar to the logo on the liquor bottles.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Will Kollias help the characters find the brewers?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Currently, Kollias' men are tied up with the overwhelming unrest in Knotside. He doesn't have a single hand to spare. However, he does offer a map to the mountain range.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Have you hired anyone else for this job?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So far, Kollias hasn't come across any other adventurers. What few adventurers were already in Knotside were affected by the liquor. He's lucky to have caught the characters outside of the city.</p>\n<h2>Resting in Knotside</h2>\n<p>If the characters opt to stay the night in Knotside despite the&nbsp;troubles, Kollias and his men escort them to the Venerable&nbsp;Swordsman, an inn on the south side of that city that remains&nbsp;mostly unaffected by the chaos. The majority of the shops,&nbsp;taverns, and other points of interest in Knotside are currently&nbsp;closed. Kollias, fearful for his city, urges the characters not to&nbsp;waste too much time. He can procure whatever they need in&nbsp;terms of arms, ammunition, and armor from the town's&nbsp;armory. He can also grant up to 4 potions of healing per&nbsp;character and any basic supplies they might require.</p>\n<p>Should the characters dally too long, Kollias eventually&nbsp;grows impatient and seeks out another group to solve the&nbsp;issue.</p>","img":""}
