The pier is so busy that no one takes notice of the characters until they are on a vessel.</p><p>Jarlaxle's flagship is anchored in Deepwater Harbor, a mile away from his other ships. To reach the <i>Eyecatcher</i>, the characters must travel there by using another vessel, by swimming, or by flying. If the characters approach in a vessel known to the crew, such as a rowboat from another of Jarlaxle's ships, the characters arouse no suspicion until they are seen on deck.

These captains know of Jarlaxle's plans. They communicate with each other and with Jarlaxle by way of <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Mjk0OGViOTEyZjIx ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>sending</a></i> spells, which they prepare instead of <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MmUwZDY3OWM5ZDFm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>fly</a></i>.</p><p>Velgos Ephezzrin captains the <i>Hellraiser</i> in the guise of a human named <b>Fergus Crabwater</b>.

He's a humorless taskmaster whose tarantula familiar is always on his shoulder.</p><p>Llorath Pharn captains the <i>Eyecatcher</i> as a human named <b>Tarwind Arryhook</b>. He loves games of chance and can't resist a good wager.</p><p>A successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check and the mention of Zardoz Zord's name is enough to gain an audience with a ship captain. If the characters capture one of the captains and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check, they learn the following information by asking the right questions:</p><ul><li>“The Sea Maidens Faire and all its ships are under the command of Captain Zardoz Zord of Luskan.” (A ship captain won't divulge Zord's true identity unless magically compelled to do so.)</li><li>“Zord has a cabin aboard the <i>Eyecatcher</i> and spends a lot of time there with Margo Verida and Khafeyta Murzan, two of the Faire's star performers.”</li><li>“A year ago, the Sea Maidens Faire visited the island nation of Lantan, where Zord acquired a submarine called the <i>Scarlet Marpenoth</i>. The submarine is mounted underneath the <i>Eyecatcher</i>.”</li><li>“Zord has operatives searching for an artifact called the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>, which leads to a place called the Vault of Dragons.” (For security, the captains aren't kept informed as to the mission's progress.)</li><li>“Zord has drow spies in Waterdeep—<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTJiNGJlNTc2MjQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Fel'rekt Lafeen</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTBhNjQwNTY2MDFk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Krebbyg Masq'il'yr</a>, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjlkNzNjNWM5ZTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Soluun Xibrindas</a>. All carry Lantanese firearms.”</li><li>“Our disguises are powered by a magical figurehead fixed to the fore of each ship.”</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>Sailors</h4><p>The <i>Eyecatcher</i>, the <i>Heartbreaker</i>, and the <i>Hellraiser</i> are crewed by twenty sailors each: three <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTk1ODRlNTdjN2Qw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow elite warriors</a></b> (mates) and seventeen <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmIxMzgwZTgyODdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow</a></b>, all magically disguised as slender humans while aboard their vessel. All are loyal members of Bregan D'aerthe, and all know that Zardoz Zord is <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkMzA3NzY2ZmMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jarlaxle Baenre</a> in disguise. They know nothing about the <i>Scarlet Marpenoth</i> or Jarlaxle's plans.</p><p>The crew has orders not to fraternize with strangers or guests. Characters who question crew members can learn the following:</p><ul><li>“Zardoz Zord is master of the Sea Maidens Faire. If you want to meet him, talk to a ship captain.” (A sailor won't divulge Zord's true identity unless magically compelled to do so.)</li><li>“The Sea Maidens Faire is based out of Luskan.”</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>Carnies</h4><p>Most of the carnival performers and workers are human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></b> trained to perform a handful of tasks or stunts. (Performers have proficiency in the Performance skill.) They're kept in the dark about most things, but they're not oblivious. With a successful DC 10 Charisma check, a character can cajole or trick a carny into revealing one of the following pieces of information:</p><ul><li>“Zardoz Zord uses magic to get from the <i>Eyecatcher</i> to the other boats. I've never seen him in a rowboat.”</li><li>“The sailors communicate with each other using odd hand signals.” (Members of Bregan D'aerthe use Drow Sign Language.)</li><li>“All the sailors have an aversion to sunlight.”</li><li>“Have you noticed the sailors have the slightest hint of an Elvish accent?”</li><li>“All the crew members are men. Very odd.”</li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Discovering the Drow</span><br></p><p>Any character who spends 1 hour observing a ship's crew can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. With a successful check, the character notices that most crew members speak Common with an Elvish accent and exchange hand signals when they think no one is looking. A drow character recognizes the hand signals as Drow Sign Language.</p><p>The changes wrought by the magic of the ships' figureheads (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTZlNWIyMGMyMWY4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area J8</a>) fail to hold up to physical inspection, meaning that characters who interact with crew members have a chance to notice the illusion. For example, a character who grabs one of the sailors by the ear would quickly realize by touch that the ear is pointed, not rounded as it appears. Additionally, any drow character who boards one of these ships instantly takes on the illusory form of a human of the same gender, height, and weight, because of the magic of the ship's figurehead.</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/013_-_Dragon_Heist_3A_Autumn_Adventure/001_-_Chapter_7_3A_Maestro_27s_Fall/001_-_Sea_Maidens_Faire/avatar.png"}

Posters on the outside walls advertise the latest shows, <i>Meet the Goodberrys</i> and <i>Kiss of the Lamia</i>. The former is a comical glimpse into the travails of a large halfling family engaged in illicit criminal activity. The latter is a tragic play about an evil Mulhorandi prince who is banished to a desert, charmed by a lamia, and sent back with powerful magic items to conquer his homeland in her name.<br></span><br>In the early hours of the morning, the backstage area is abuzz with halfling actors donning costumes, wigs, and makeup in preparation for the afternoon's show. As that show wraps, the cast and musicians for the evening's tragic fare arrive. The actor who plays the evil prince is a woman named Yaliek Iltizmar (N female Rashemi <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE5M2E2NDQ4M2I3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bard</a></b>), who is also a member of the Harpers. She pays close attention to characters who nose around backstage, then shares any interesting revelations with <b>Remallia Haventree</b>&nbsp;at the earliest opportunity. If Remallia learns the location of the Vault of Dragons, she sees that the information reaches the Lords of Waterdeep by conveying it to Mirt.<p></p><hr><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">Theater Owner</span><br></p><p>The owner of the Pink Flumph, Iokaste Daliano (N female Tethyrian <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b>), is a selfish, middle-aged widow with no great love of theater. The Pink Flumph was her husband's passion; for Iokaste, it's strictly a means through which she can rub shoulders with the city's elite. She requires the directors to choose plays and hire actors, while she spends her time “on the job” greeting important guests and promising them the finest entertainment. She treats her actors and staff like half-forgotten children, and she turns away characters who come to the theater seeking the Vault of Dragons unless there's something in it for her. Appealing to her greed backfires, since Iokaste wants all the treasure for herself.<br><br></p><h4>Path to the Vault</h4>One of the dressing rooms (area P8) contains a secret trapdoor in the floor that no one knows about. It can be found with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. This stone door has an arcane lock spell cast on it and can be pulled open with a successful DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. A <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Knock#content\">knock</a></i> spell or similar magic also does the trick.<br><br>Below the trapdoor is a 30-foot-deep shaft containing a wooden ladder. Characters who descend the ladder find themselves at one end of a 20-foot-wide stone passageway that gradually slopes down 100 feet before ending at the entrance to the Vault of Dragons.<br><br><h4>Wishes the Faerie Dragon</h4>Iokaste's late husband, Algondar Daliano, had a violet faerie dragon companion named Wishes. The <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjYyOWM4NjI1NzM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>faerie dragon</a></b> detests Iokaste but remains on the payroll, begrudgingly using its magic to enhance performances for the sake of preserving Algondar's legacy. It prefers to remain invisible and unseen otherwise. Iokaste refers to it derisively as “the flying serpent.”<br><br>If the characters threaten it or endanger the theater, Wishes uses its magic to confound and neutralize them. As they make their way to the Vault of Dragons, it follows them invisibly. Once it learns about the gold in the vault, the faerie dragon casts mirror image on itself, turns visible, and addresses the characters telepathically. It demands a share of the hoard (at least 5,000 gp), threatens to tip off the City Watch if the characters refuse, and makes good on its threat if the characters don't share the wealth. The faerie dragon doesn't have a hoard of its own, since it gives its earnings to unfortunate Waterdavians by invisibly flying around the city at night and leaving coins on doorsteps, window sills, nightstands, and pillows.<p></p><p></p></section>","img":""}

Alternatively, you can begin this adventure as the characters first enter the raucous tavern, or by having them all meet for the first time as Volo hands them their initial quest.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Tavern Brawl</span></h4><p>As the characters are relaxing in the taproom of the Yawning Portal, a fistfight breaks out. Read the following to set the scene:</p><blockquote><p>You sit around a sturdy wooden table lit by a brightly burning candle and littered with plates cleared of food and half-drained tankards. The sounds of gamblers yelling and drunken adventurers singing bawdy songs nearly drown out the off-key strumming of a young bard three tables over.</p><p><br>Then all the noise is eclipsed by a shout: “Ya pig! Like killin' me mates, does ya?” Then a seven-foot-tall half-orc is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a male human whose shaved head is covered with eye-shaped tattoos. Four other humans stand behind him, ready to jump into the fray. The half-orc cracks her knuckles, roars, and leaps at the tattooed figure—but before you can see if blood is drawn, a crowd of spectators clusters around the brawl. What do you do?</p></blockquote><p>The human combatants are five members of the Xanathar Guild (CE human&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzAzZTRmMDczZTBj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><b>bandits</b></a>). The one with the eye-shaped tattoos on his bald pate is their leader, Krentz. Their foe,&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTQwN2NjYjY4Zjlj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Yagra Stonefist</a>, is a half-orc employed by the Zhentarim (see the&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2I3ODAzN2QxZTE4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Yawning Portal Friendly Faces</a>&nbsp;handouts). Yagra fights for her pride.<br></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Getting Involved</h4><p>If the characters choose to join the fray, have everyone roll initiative. But the fight is almost over by the time they push through the rowdy spectators. Krentz has only 3 hit points remaining and is trying to escape from underneath Yagra, but the four other Xanathar Guild members are poised to tackle her.</p><p>Pulling Yagra away from Krentz requires a successful Strength check contested by Yagra's Strength check. Yagra thanks the characters if they help her, but is disappointed that they interfered in the fight.</p><p>Remember how the characters deal with Krentz in this scene. If he survives, the characters might meet him again in one of the Xanathar Guild's sewer hideouts (see area Q5).</p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Hanging Back</h4><p>If the characters don't interfere in the brawl, Yagra knocks Krentz out cold but is then beaten unconscious by his companions. Durnan, the proprietor of the Yawning Portal, points toward the door. “Out!” he snarls, and the Xanathar Guild members flee carrying Krentz's unconscious form.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Troll and Friends</span></h4><p>In the third round of the brawl, trouble arises from out of the gaping well in the middle of the Yawning Portal's taproom:</p><blockquote><p>Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the taproom—a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and bloodshot eyes. As it bares its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep, Durnan, who shouts, “Troll!”</p></blockquote><p>The&nbsp;<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODQ0MGIxYmY2MGJh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>troll</a></b>, which currently has 44 hit points, has crawled up from the first level of Undermountain to feed on tasty humanoid flesh, bringing nine&nbsp;<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjUwODExYWYwMzhm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>stirges</a></b>&nbsp;with it. Once in the taproom, the troll rises to its full height of 9 feet and rolls initiative. The stirges also roll initiative, but only the three flying above the troll pose a threat. The remaining stirges are bloated, having drained copious amounts of the troll's blood, and fly back down the shaft to digest their meal. As the troll regenerates, the effects of its blood loss become less apparent.</p><p>Most tavern patrons and staffers flee or take cover at the sight of the troll. The stirges attack the nearest characters as&nbsp;<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjEzM2I2YWMzNThk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Durnan</a></b>&nbsp;draws his great­sword, springs over the bar, and confronts the monster himself. As he attacks, he calls on the characters to focus on slaying the stirges and then douse the troll with lamp oil and set it on fire when it falls. Yagra joins the fight if she's conscious. To any characters who help defeat the troll, Durnan says matter-of-factly, “You fought well.”</p><p>If any of the characters are reduced to 0 hit points during the fight, employees of the Yawning Portal step forward to stabilize them.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Meeting Volo</span></h4><p>Once the troll and the stirges are dealt with, Volo pushes against the tide of patrons staying clear of the monster to greet the characters, lavishing praise on them for their bravery (whether justified or not): “You be adventurers, am I right? I could use your help. Let's find a table to talk, shall we?”</p><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWM5N2VjMGZkZWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Volothamp Geddarm</a>&nbsp;is known to most Waterdavians as a braggart and a notorious embellisher of facts. For all his faults, though, Volo is a soft-hearted sort who cares for nothing as much as his friends. At present, he is grievously concerned for the well-being of one of them. He begins his request with an air of charm and mystery, but it quickly devolves into tearful sincerity.</p><blockquote><p>The figure who approached you strokes his mustache, adjusts his floppy hat, and tightens his scarf. “Volothamp Geddarm, chronicler, wizard, and celebrity, at your service. I trust you've noted the violence in our fair city these past tendays. I haven't seen so much blood since my last visit to Baldur's Gate! But now I fear I have misplaced a friend amid this odious malevolence.</p><p>“My friend's name is Floon Blagmaar. He's got more beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home a couple nights ago and was kidnapped—or worse. If you agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer you ten dragons apiece now, and I can give you each ten times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in my hour of need?”</p></blockquote><p>Volo gives each character a small pouch containing 10 gp simply for accepting his quest. Characters who want to discover his intentions must make a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, a character discerns that Volo is honest but might be stretching the truth about how much he can pay. (Currently low on cash, Volo is awaiting royalty payments from&nbsp;<i>Volo's Guide to Monsters</i>. To make more coin, he began work on a new book,&nbsp;<i>Volo's Guide to Spirits and Specters</i>. As it happens, his knowledge of spirits mostly concerns the alcoholic variety, and the writing has not been going well.) If pressed, Volo urges the characters to trust him, and promises he'll have the rest of the reward, 100 gp per character, ready to deliver once Floon is returned to him alive.<br></p><p>Volo describes Floon as a handsome human male in his early thirties with wavy red-blond hair. He was dressed in princely garb when Volo last saw him. Two nights ago, before Floon disappeared, he and Volo were drinking and merrymaking at the Skewered Dragon, a dark, bawdy tavern in the&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjFmODNmZDI3Nzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Dock Ward</a>. Volo recommends that the characters start their search there.</p><p></p><p><br></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">What Happened That Night?</h4><p>Volo is embarrassed to admit he might have gotten his friend Floon in trouble, and he resists providing all the details of what happened the night Floon disappeared.</p><p>Beset by writer's block, Volo met&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWIyNWI5ZTRmYmI2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Floon Blagmaar</a>&nbsp;for drinks at the Skewered Dragon two nights ago. They drank and gambled for a few hours, and then Volo left. That's the last he saw of Floon.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Volo, not long after he departed, a drunken Floon met another acquaintance, Lord&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjVkOTBiZjc2MjEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Renaer Neverember</a>, at the tavern. The two left together, with Renaer offering to walk Floon home. Five Zhentarim thugs working for&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWU2N2EyYjA0ZTU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Urstul Floxin</a>&nbsp;jumped both Floon and Renaer. They took them to a warehouse in the Dock Ward, so they could question Renaer—the son of Lord Dagult Neverember—about the whereabouts of the&nbsp;<i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>&nbsp;and his father's hidden cache of dragons. Before the interrogation could begin, members of the Xanathar Guild ambushed and killed the Zhent guards in the warehouse. The new arrivals mistook Floon for Renaer, knocked Floon unconscious, and dragged him away while Renaer hid and escaped their notice.</p><p>Floon was taken to a Xanathar Guild hideout in the sewers. A small gang of kenku was left behind at the Zhentarim warehouse to kill any other Zhents who might show up at the warehouse. The presence of the kenku has prevented Renaer from trying to leave the warehouse.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Finding Floon</span></h4><p>Volo last saw Floon outside the Skewered Dragon, a dubious (and Zhentarim-owned) tavern between Net Street and Fillet Lane in the Dock Ward. The following encounters kick off the characters' investigation.</p><p>En route to the tavern, “Blood in the Streets” is a chance for characters to see the City Watch in action. If the characters decide to look around, “Searching the Dock Ward” gives them a feel for their surroundings, and they might discover a strange place, “Old Xoblob Shop,” that warrants further exploration. Once they arrive at their destination, “The Skewered Dragon” is an opportunity for the characters to get information from the patrons, which leads them to “Candle Lane,” where their quest continues.</p><p><br></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit\">Blood in the Streets</span></h4><p>As the characters travel through the Dock Ward, they come upon the aftermath of a bloody clash between the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim:</p><blockquote><p>As you turn a corner, you find yourselves on a street that has been cordoned off by the City Watch. Lying on the cobblestones are a half-dozen corpses, seemingly the victims of some terrible skirmish. Watch officers have disarmed and arrested three blood-drenched humans and are in the midst of questioning witnesses. One of the officers sees you. “Get on,” she says. “Nothing to see here.”</p></blockquote><p>The skirmish that occurred here has nothing to do with Floon's disappearance but represents an escalation in the conflict between the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild. A dozen&nbsp;<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDJkNmQ0MmYxODgw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a></b>&nbsp;of the City Watch have arrested three&nbsp;<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzAzZTRmMDczZTBj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bandits</a></b>&nbsp;and are questioning witnesses while waiting for wagons to take away the criminals and the corpses. The survivors of the skirmish have been stripped of their weapons and forced to kneel with their hands on their heads. All three, loyal Zhentarim agents (employed by Urstul Floxin), are likely to be accused of murder. They coldly catch the eye of anyone who passes by, but the City Watch won't let the characters anywhere near the prisoners.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\"><br></span></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit\">Searching the Dock Ward</span></h4><p>The Dock Ward is unsafe. You can set the mood by reading the following to the players:</p><blockquote><p>Tall, densely packed tenements leave most of the neighborhood in shadow at ground level. Most of the streetlamps have had their glass smashed and their candles stolen, and the smells of salt air and excrement linger as you pass by rows of run-down buildings.</p></blockquote><p>On the corner of Zastrow Street and Fillet Lane is a shop with a peculiar window display:<br></p><blockquote><p>One nearby shop stands out from the others. It has a deep purple facade, and in its window hangs a stuffed beholder. Above the door hangs a sign whose elaborate letters spell out “Old Xoblob Shop.”</p></blockquote><p>If the characters check out the shop, continue with “Old Xoblob Shop.” If they don't, they find the tavern without further incident; see “The Skewered Dragon” below.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\"><br></span></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit\">Old Xoblob Shop</span></h4><p>When the characters enter, they quickly get a sense of the strangeness of the place:</p><blockquote><p>A cloud of lavender-scented purple smoke trails out of the shop's door as you peer inside. Every wall is painted purple, and every dusty knickknack on the shelves is dyed a deep violet. The hairless old gnome sitting cross-legged on the counter wears plum-colored robes. His cheeks are decorated with nine purple face-painted eyes.</p><p>The gnome lowers a pipe and exhales a cloud of lavender smoke before raising a hand. “Hail and well met! Come browse the shelves of the most curious curiosity shop in the world!”</p></blockquote><p>The shop is named after the stuffed beholder in the window—a fixture that is actually a magical sensor, through which Xanathar can peer whenever it wishes.<br></p><p>The shopkeeper is a wizened&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Mzk4ZDJiMDhmYmM5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>deep gnome</a><b></b>&nbsp;who spies for the Xanathar Guild. A few years ago, he survived the detonation of a gas spore in Undermountain and inherited some stray beholder memories. Driven by a compulsion to carve out his own domain, the gnome settled in Waterdeep, bought the Old Xoblob Shop from its previous owner, and tried renaming it after himself, yet everyone kept calling it the Old Xoblob Shop. He therefore restored the old name and changed his name to Xoblob. “No relation to the eye tyrant hanging in the window!” he says.</p><p><b><i>Trinkets.</i></b>&nbsp;The gnome sells an assortment of trinkets. As the characters search the shelves, roll on the Trinkets table from the&nbsp;<i>Player's Handbook</i>&nbsp;to determine what catches their eye. Xoblob sells any trinket for 1d6 gp.</p><p><b><i>Floon's Fate.</i></b>&nbsp;The gnome doesn't know Floon by name, but he recognizes his description. He is reluctant to share information, but offering him a new purple item or succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check loosens his tongue. He says that Floon and a well-dressed fellow of similar appearance and bearing (Renaer Neverember, though the gnome doesn't know his name and didn't recognize him) were jumped outside the shop by rough-looking men in black leather armor. Xoblob thinks there were five attackers, but none of them looked familiar. One of them had a black tattoo of a winged snake on his neck.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\"><br></span></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit\">The Skewered Dragon</span></h4><p>The Skewered Dragon faces an alley that runs between Net Street and Fillet Lane in the Dock Ward, not far from the Old Xoblob Shop. When the characters approach it, read:</p><blockquote><p>The Skewered Dragon looks like a ruin. Both of its front-facing windows are smashed, and a ship's anchor is lodged in the roof. Through the windows, you can see a group of haggard patrons drinking from huge tankards.</p></blockquote><p>Floon has not been at the Skewered Dragon since the night of his disappearance, and the dive's dockworker patrons are loath to talk to strangers. A bribe or a successful DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check gets them to open up.<br></p><p><b><i>Floon's Fate.</i></b>&nbsp;Several of the regulars remember seeing Volo and Floon drinking together a couple of nights ago. After Volo left, Floon stuck around long enough to meet with another friend:&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjVkOTBiZjc2MjEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Renaer Neverember</a>, the son of Waterdeep's previous Open Lord, Dagult Neverember. “Chip off the old block, that one!” sneers one patron. “Just another spoiled, rich noble who likes to rub our noses in it!” says another.</p><p>The two drank and played a few rounds of Three-Dragon Ante before leaving around midnight. Five men followed them out, and no one in the tavern knows what happened after that. The men who left shortly after Floon and Renaer haven't returned to the tavern since, but they're known to frequent a warehouse on Candle Lane. “Look for the snake symbol on the door,” says one of the tavern regulars.</p><p><br></p><h4><span style=\"font-family: inherit ; color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">Candle Lane</span></h4><p>The buildings on either side of Candle Lane are so tall and so tightly packed together that light touches the street only at highsun.</p><blockquote><p>Gloom envelops a narrow alley as dark as a dungeon—and as odorous as one, too. Nearly all the streetlamps have been smashed. The only light that pierces the darkness is a faint flickering from down the lane, like a distant candle.</p></blockquote><p>The flickering comes from the one streetlamp still intact on Candle Lane, kept alight by a&nbsp;<i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZWIyNjY0MDNmM2Nm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>continual flame</a></i>&nbsp;spell. A warehouse is directly across the street from the lamp, which illuminates a black winged snake (the symbol of the Zhentarim) painted above the door's handle. Characters who have ties to the Zhentarim recognize the symbol, while others can recall its significance with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check.</p></section>","img":""}

Such supernatural gifts come in two forms: blessings and charms. A blessing is usually bestowed by a god or a godlike being. A charm is typically the work of a powerful spirit, a location of ancient magic, or a creature that has legendary actions. Unlike a magic item, a supernatural gift isn’t an object and doesn’t require attunement. It gives a character an extraordinary ability, which can be used one or more times.</span></span><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><br></span></p></h3><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\">Blessings</span></h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">A character might receive a blessing from a deity for something truly momentous—an accomplishment that catches the attention of both gods and mortals. Killing rampaging gnolls rarely warrants a blessing, but slaying the high priest of Tiamat as he attempts to summon the Dragon Queen might.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">A blessing is an appropriate award for one of the following accomplishments:</span></span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">Restoring the most sacred shrine of a god</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">Foiling an earthshaking plot by the enemies of a god</span></span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">Helping a god's favored servant complete a holy quest</span></span></li></ul><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">An adventurer might also receive a blessing in advance of a perilous quest.

A god typically gives a blessing for a particular purpose, such as recovering a holy person's remains or toppling a tyrannical empire. The god might revoke a blessing if a character fails to pursue that purpose or acts counter to it.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">A character retains the benefits of a blessing forever or until it is taken away by the god who granted it. Unlike a magic item, such a blessing can't be suppressed by an </span><i style=\"font-weight: normal\"><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Antimagic%20Field#content\">antimagic field</a></i><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">&nbsp;or similar effect.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">Most adventurers go their entire lives without receiving even one of these blessings. There is no limit on the number of blessings a character can receive, but it should be rare for a character to have more than one at a time. Moreover, a character can't benefit from multiple instances of a blessing at the same time. For example, a character can't benefit from two instances of the Blessing of Health at once.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">Example blessings are provided below. The text of a blessing addresses its user. If you decide to create more blessings, consider this: a typical blessing mimics the properties of a wondrous item.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><i><b>Blessing of Health. </b></i><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">Your Constitution score increases by 2, up to a maximum of 22.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><i><b>Blessing of Protection. </b></i><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><i><b>Blessing of Magic Resistance. </b></i><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><i><b>Blessing of Understanding.</b> </i><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">Your Wisdom score increases by 2, up to a maximum of 22.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><i><b>Blessing of Valhalla. </b></i><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">This blessing grants you the power to summon spirit warriors, as if you had blown a silver </span><i style=\"font-weight: normal\">horn of Valhalla</i><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">.

For example, a wizard who finds an eldritch secret in a dead arch mage's spellbook might be infused with the magic of a charm, as might a character who solves a sphinx's riddle or drinks from a magic fountain. Legendary creatures, such as ancient gold dragons and unicorns, sometimes grace their allies with charms, and some explorers find themselves bearing the magic of a charm after discovering a long-lost location that is drenched in primeval magic.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: normal ; color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\">Some charms can be used only once, and others can be used a specific number of times before vanishing. If a charm lets you cast a spell, you are able to do so without spending a spell slot or providing any components (verbal, somatic, or material). In any case, a charm can't be used in the area created by an <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Antimagic%20Field#content\">antimagic field</a></i> or a similar effect, and a charm's effects are susceptible to <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODY4Zjg3NjhmMDkw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>dispel magic</a></i> and the like. But the charm itself can't be removed from a creature by anything short of divine intervention or the&nbsp;</span><em style=\"font-weight: normal ; color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MDM1YmRiNzgzM2Zl ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>wish</a></em><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">&nbsp;spell.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 )\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal\">Example charms are provided below.

A fire swept through the area a little over a year ago, and most of the buildings are now burned-out shells with (at best) sails for roofs. Fishing poles and nets line the dock, and the 15-foot-deep water is covered by a thick layer of ice during the winter.</p><hr><p><h3 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Areas of Mistshore</h3>Mistshore is a riotous assemblage of ramshackle homes made of wood from old ships and inhabited by impoverished Waterdavians. Several buildings were reduced to ash by the fire last year. Although some were rebuilt, others were ruined beyond repair and are now used as roofless dens by homeless children and rats.<br><br>The following locations are keyed to the Mistshore map.<br><br><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">D1.

At any given time, 4d6 <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzAzZTRmMDczZTBj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bandits</a></b> loiter on deck, hoping that someone who needs muscle will offer them work.

Her ramshackle home contains an unmade bed, an alchemist's laboratory, a small stove, a coat rack, a table, a stool, a stuffed chair in poor condition, a wash basin, and a locked wooden sea chest with a glyph of warding spell cast on it. Grinda carries the key, and the glyph triggers an explosive runes effect (see the spell description in the Player's Handbook) if anyone other than Grinda lifts the lid of the chest.<br><br><b><i>Chest.&nbsp;</i></b>Grinda's chest contains a heavy iron key that locks and unlocks the Garloth family mausoleum in the City of the Dead.</p><p><p><br></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">D3. Grinda's Apparatus</h4>Grinda Garloth keeps her&nbsp;<i>apparatus of Kwalish</i>&nbsp;here when she's not using the vehicle to hunt for treasure in Deepwater Harbor. While the apparatus is here, it floats in an enclosed dock. Underwater metal doors leading out to the harbor are kept shut by an iron bar across the inside. The apparatus can lift the iron bar automatically; a creature inside the bay can lift it with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.<br><br><b><i>Borrowing the Apparatus.&nbsp;</i></b>Grinda allows the characters to borrow her&nbsp;<i>apparatus of Kwalish</i>&nbsp;on the condition that they first use the device to search the bottom of Deepwater Harbor for treasure and give her half of whatever they find. To meet the mage's demands, the characters must spend a day searching the harbor. At the end of the day, the pilot makes an Intelligence (Investigation) check. Multiply the total of the check by 10 to determine the gold piece value of any treasure found. Grinda sells the bounty and gives half to the characters.<br><br>As the characters search the harbor for treasure, roll any die. If an even number is rolled, an awakened shark named <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjExYTk4MDBlYTc0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Obliteros</a></b>&nbsp;attacks them.

On the north side of the area, stairs rise to an open level above.</p></blockquote><p>If the kenku aren't hidden, add:<br></p><blockquote><p>Four short, avian creatures with long beaks and black feathers look over in surprise from where they stand in the middle of the warehouse. Each wears a hooded cloak and wields a shortsword.</p></blockquote><p>The corpses belong to five human Zhentarim sellswords (the same ones who kidnapped Floon and Renaer) and seven human Xanathar Guild thugs, all of them clad in leather armor. Each Zhent has a black tattoo of a winged snake on his neck or forearm, and one of the Xanathar Guild members has a black tattoo on the palm of his right hand that looks like a circle with ten spokes radiating out from its circumference (the symbol of Xanathar).<br></p><p>The kenku fight until two of them are incapacitated or killed, whereupon the survivors try to flee. A successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check forces captured kenku to divulge what they know.</p><h4>What the Kenku Know</h4><p>When kenku speak, they mimic sounds and voices they have heard before. Under interrogation, they repeat the following phrases:</p><ul><li>In a deep voice with an orcish accent: “Xanathar sends its regards.”</li><li>In a thin, nasally voice: “Tie up the pretty boy in the back room!” and “Follow the yellow signs in the sewers.” (This remark refers to tunnels in the sewers that are marked with Xanathar's symbol where they lead to the Xanathar Guild hideout.)</li><li>In a scratchy voice: “No time to loot the place. Just get him to the boss.”</li></ul><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Z2. Storage Closet</span></h3><p>The door to this back room hangs loosely on broken hinges. The cramped chamber beyond smells strongly of sour fish and vinegar. It is filled with discarded ropes, canvas tarpaulins, and splintered wood from smashed barrels. Renaer Neverember is hiding here, having slipped free of his rope bonds. The characters can hear his ragged breathing coming from under a tarpaulin at the north end of the room.</p><h4>Roleplaying Renaer</h4><p>Renaer is unarmed. Marred by grime and the lingering stench of rancid pickled herring, he speaks with grace and articulation, as befits his noble upbringing. His trust is easily gained but impossible to restore once broken.</p><p>On the night of the abduction, Renaer was concerned that Floon was too intoxicated to find his way home by himself and offered to escort him. The two were jumped by five thugs as they left Fillet Lane and headed north on Zastrow Street.<br></p><p>Renaer feels guilty that Floon was taken, since he believes (correctly) that they mistook Floon for him. If the characters ask Renaer to join their search for Floon, he agrees to do so, arming himself with a dagger and a rapier scavenged from the dead Zhents in the warehouse.</p><p>If a character asks Renaer why the Zhents kidnapped him, he gives the following truthful reply:</p><blockquote><p>“The Zhentarim thinks that my father embezzled a large amount of gold while he was Open Lord, and that he hid the dragons somewhere in the city. They think they can find it by using an artifact called the Stone of Golorr, which was in the hands of the Xanathar Guild until recently. Apparently, someone stole it. The Zhents thought I knew something about all of this, but I don't. My father and I haven't spoken in years.”</p></blockquote><hr><h3>Z3. Secret Room</h3><p>This room is hidden behind a secret door that can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. When the secret door is opened, the characters can hear the faint sound of a bell ringing in the offices above them (area Z5).</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>The Zhents have stashed two wooden crates here. The first, stolen from the docks, contains four wood-framed paintings wrapped in leather. The paintings depict the cities of Luskan, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, and Baldur's Gate and are worth 75 gp each.</p><p>The second crate, stolen from a caravan on the High Road, contains fifteen 10-pound silver trade bars, all black from corrosion but still worth 50 gp each.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Z4. Balcony</span></h3><p>The open second level is stacked with crates where it overlooks the main warehouse. Characters who search through the crates find all sorts of junk, including moth-eaten bolts of cloth, bottles of spoiled olive oil, and hundreds of pairs of wooden-soled sandals that were all the rage last summer but are now out of fashion. None of this junk is valuable.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Z5. Offices</span></h3><p>The upper floor contains a suite of offices that get little use by the Zhents. The rooms have desks, chairs, and bare shelves covered with dust and draped in cobwebs. Harmless <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTljNWFhZDk0ZjYy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>rats</a></b> skitter about.</p><p>Mounted above each office door is a steel alarm bell. The bells are connected by wires to the secret door in area Z3, and they ring loudly when that door is opened.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>A character who searches the offices finds an unused <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGQxMjc0ZTgyZmVm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>paper bird</a></i>.</p><hr><h2><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 24px ; font-weight: bold\">The Watch Arrives</span></h2><p>Shortly after the characters find Renaer, a captain of the City Watch named Hyustus Staget (LG male Illuskan human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veteran</a></b>) leads a dozen <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veterans</a></b> to the warehouse. Having received a report of suspicious activity, they barge in and try to prevent anyone from leaving. Kenku that are still alive and present are taken into custody, and it doesn't take long for the City Watch to conclude that the dead men are members of the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild, since violent encounters between the two factions are becoming ever more frequent. While his constables search the warehouse, Captain Staget questions the characters.</p><p>Captain Staget is an uptight man who helps keep the peace in the Dock Ward. Every shopkeeper, guild member, innkeeper, and tavern keeper in the Dock Ward knows him, and most respect him regardless of their opinions of the City Watch in general. Staget doesn't believe in rumors or gossip, he doesn't drink, and he doesn't let anger get the better of him. His job is to curb the violence in the Dock Ward, but he has been dragging his heels. After all, he reasons, if the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim want to destroy each other, why not let them?</p><p>Staget once had the warehouse under surveillance, but elected to pull the detail to bolster patrols throughout the Dock Ward—a decision he now regrets. That surveillance was part of an attempt to catch a known Zhent instigator named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWU2N2EyYjA0ZTU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Urstul Floxin</a>, a “big fish” rumored to be responsible for much of the recent strife. Staget doesn't share this information with strangers.</p><p>Staget and Renaer recognize each other, though they aren't well acquainted. The involvement of a Neverember noble prompts the captain to be on his best behavior. He is prepared to overlook any crimes committed by the characters as long as Renaer is with them, but he gives them a folded sheet of parchment with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTg2ZjhhMjQ4NGIy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>the Code Legal</a> written on it and encourages them to read it. (Give the players a copy of the Code Legal handout, if you haven't done so already.)</p><p>If the characters ask for the Watch's help in locating Floon, Staget makes it clear that he won't send a force into the sewers in search of someone who might well be a Zhent or Xanathar Guild spy. If they appear intent on involving themselves further in the conflict between the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild, Staget imparts some free advice before letting them go:</p><ul><li>“Best not to meddle in criminal matters. Leave this dirty business to the City Watch.”</li><li>“Not all City Watch officers are as nice as me.”</li><li>“Keep the blood off the streets, okay?” (This is a common saying among City Watch officials, who care more about what happens in the city above than what happens in the sewers below.)</li></ul><p>Characters who stir up trouble in the Dock Ward are likely to run into Captain Staget again. Though he is secretly pleased to have adventurers doing some of his work for him, he can't let them overshadow his own efforts to keep the peace without risking a reprimand from his superiors.</p><hr><h2><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 24px ; font-weight: bold\">Tracking Floon</span></h2><p>At this point, the characters likely know that Floon was kidnapped by Xanathar Guild members who mistook him for Renaer Neverember, and that he was taken to a hideout in the sewers. If the characters didn't learn from the kenku where Floon was taken, asking questions of the locals can reveal that many people saw him being dragged off. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check or 5 gp in bribes allows the characters to trace the kidnappers' path through back alleys to a circular metal cover inset in the pavement. The cover is easily lifted, revealing a ladder down into the sewers.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Navigating the Sewers</span></h3><p>The sewers have no natural light. Characters without darkvision need light sources to see.</p><blockquote><p>A putrid stream flows along this sewer tunnel, which leads in two directions. In one direction, you see a tiny symbol drawn on the wall in yellow chalk: a palm-sized circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating out from its circumference.</p></blockquote><p>The hideout of the Xanathar Guild operatives who snatched up Floon is deep in the city's labyrinthine sewers. At every location where characters must make a decision about which direction to go, a symbol scrawled in yellow chalk—a stylized representation of Xanathar—is marked next to the tunnel that leads in the right direction. The symbols are erased by members of the Xanathar Guild or the Dungsweepers' Guild every few days, but these markings have yet to be removed.<br></p><h4>Gazer Guard</h4><p>Before arriving at the Xanathar Guild hideout, the characters have an encounter in the sewers:</p><blockquote><p>After an hour of following signs through the tunnels, you come to a three-way intersection where a ladder leads up into a stone shaft capped by a circular metal cover. One of the familiar chalk symbols is marked on a wall nearby, and floating near the symbol is a spherical, grapefruit-sized creature with a bulging central eye and four stumpy eyestalks. It bares its teeth at you.</p></blockquote><p>A hostile <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDk4ZTg3ZjFiYjJm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>gazer</a></b> that is in league with Grum'shar, the local Xanathar Guild boss, guards this intersection. Once the characters defeat it, they can press on, following the corridor where the chalk symbol is located; they reach the hideout after following the correct tunnel for 5 minutes.<br></p><p><b><i>Ladder.</i></b> Characters who climb the ladder and push open the metal cover find themselves in the cellar of the Spouting Fish, a tavern in the Dock Ward.</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/001_-_Chapter_1_3A_A_Friend_in_Need/002_-_Zhentarim_Hideout/avatar.png"}

Our story begins with the gathering of adventurers at the Yawning Portal Inn and Tavern. Volothamp Geddarm, the famous explorer and raconteur, has a quest for them—one that entangles the characters in a bitter conflict between two nefarious organizations. If the adventurers complete his quest, Volo rewards them handsomely. Yet a much greater prize lies hidden somewhere in the City of Splendors, waiting to be claimed.</p><p><i>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</i> is a <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> adventure designed for characters starting at 1st level. By the end of the story, the characters will be at least 5th level. If you're planning to run through the adventure as a player, stop reading now!</p><p>If you're looking for higher-level adventure content set in Waterdeep, a companion product titled <i>Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage</i> explores the vast dungeon under Waterdeep known as Undermountain and is designed for characters of levels all the way up to 20th.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 24px ; font-weight: bold\">Story Overview</span></h3><p><i>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</i> is a treasure hunt set against an urban backdrop. The adventure's plot can be summarized as follows:</p><ul><li>Half a million gold coins are hidden somewhere in Waterdeep. Many individuals know about the cache and are looking for it. Adventurers can join the hunt and prevent the cache from falling into evil hands.</li><li>The city is threatened by escalating tension between two power groups that is on the verge of flaring into violence. The Zhentarim, a shadowy network of mercenaries, and Xanathar, the beholder crime lord of Waterdeep, are at odds, and when they clash, the characters are pulled into the conflict.</li></ul><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Cache of Dragons</span></h4><p>In Waterdeep, a gold coin is called a <i>dragon</i>. Before he was ousted from his position as the Open Lord of Water­deep, Dagult Neverember embezzled half a million dragons and hid them in a secret vault. As a security precaution, he arranged for all knowledge of the vault's location and defenses to be magically erased from his mind and the minds of his subordinates. The wizard who performed the procedure trapped this knowledge within an artifact called the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>. The wizard disappeared shortly thereafter, and Dagult hid the stone in the Palace of Waterdeep.</p><p>Dagult was off rebuilding the city of Neverwinter when the other Lords of Waterdeep voted him out of office. He immediately made plans to retrieve the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i> and smuggle his cache of dragons out of Waterdeep. His spies plucked the stone from the palace but were killed while trying to leave the city. The stone was stolen and passed from one hand to another like a common jewel until it wound up in the clutches of Xanathar.</p><p>The <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i> is actually an aboleth transformed by magic. In this inanimate state, the aboleth can read the mind of any creature that attunes to the stone, as well as modify that creature's memory. A creature attuned to the stone can also extract information from the aboleth, including lore about Neverember's vault.</p><p>Built long ago by dwarves, the vault is warded against all forms of magical detection and intrusion. Its current protector is an adult gold dragon named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Nzc4Njk2OWM4YzRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Aurinax</a>, who is also the current wielder and guardian of the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWZjODc0ZDQ3ODBh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</a></i>, which has the power to prevent other dragons from entering the city. In exchange for the staff, Aurinax promised to guard the gold until such time as Neverember or his appointed vassals removed it.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">War in the Streets</span></h4><p>Beneath the city streets lurks a criminal underworld, its leader a beholder called <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzMyNGExNTJhZjA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Xanathar</a>. Hoping to gain a political foothold in Waterdeep, agents of the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTVjZTZjNWJmYTZl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Zhentarim</a> (also known as the Black Network) recently tried to ally their organization with the Xanathar Guild. The architect of this attempt was a clone of the wizard <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2NlZDg4MzUzMjUw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Manshoon</a>, a founder of the Black Network long thought dead.</p><p>While the two sides were negotiating in Xanathar's lair, the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i> suddenly disappeared from where Xanathar had hidden it. The paranoid beholder accused the Black Network of stealing it and slew the Zhentarim envoys who were present. When the Zhents retaliated by attacking Xanathar Guild outposts, Xanathar took their actions as confirmation of the Black Network's vile intentions. Now the bad blood between the Zhentarim and Xanathar has begun to spill into the streets, threatening peace throughout the city.</p><p>Who actually stole the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>? The answer: a rock gnome named Dalakhar. After Lord Neverember used magic to discern the gemstone's location, he sent forth a succession of spies to infiltrate Xanathar's lair and obtain it. Dalakhar succeeded where many others before him had failed, but his success turns out to be short-lived.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Volo's Quest</span></h4><p>The Yawning Portal serves as the default starting point for this story. One of the first people the adventurers meet there is <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWM5N2VjMGZkZWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Volothamp Geddarm</a>. He has just returned from a tour promoting his latest book, <i>Volo's Guide to Monsters</i>, and he has a quest for the characters.</p><p>One of Volo's friends, a handsome simpleton named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWIyNWI5ZTRmYmI2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Floon Blagmaar</a>, has disappeared, seemingly kidnapped. The search for Floon leads to the revelation that he was caught up in a case of mistaken identity, and the characters are actually looking for two victims. The intended target was Lord Neverember's estranged son, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjVkOTBiZjc2MjEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Renaer Neverember</a>. Agents of the Zhentarim waylaid him because they want to know everything that Renaer knows about the cache of dragons. (Unfortunately for them, Renaer is ignorant of the cache and its whereabouts.) If the characters rescue him, Renaer proves to be a worthy ally to adventurers hoping to make a name for themselves in Waterdeep.</p><p>As a reward for rescuing Floon, Volo gives adventurers the deed to a building in the North Ward that looks out onto a wide cul-de-sac hemmed in by old residences and shops. The property used to be a tavern with a residence on the upper floors. The tavern has been closed for years, and the residence is haunted by a poltergeist that the characters can lay to rest.</p><p><b>Ahghairon's Dragonward<br></b>Waterdeep is blanketed by an undispellable magical effect called <i>Ahghairon's dragonward</i>. The effect originates from somewhere under Ahghairon's Tower in the Castle Ward and is permanent. Dragons and all other creatures of the dragon type are physically unable to enter the city (or its sewers) as long as the <i>dragonward</i> persists. The effect doesn't extend to the harbor or into Undermountain.</p><p>A creature of the dragon type that is touched by the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWZjODc0ZDQ3ODBh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</a></i>&nbsp;can ignore <i>Ahghairon's dragonward</i>&nbsp;and move through the city freely. The effect lasts until the creature is touched again by the staff, or until the passage of a period of time specified by one who is attuned to the staff.</p><p>The <i>dragonstaff</i> is currently in the possession of an adult gold dragon named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Nzc4Njk2OWM4YzRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Aurinax</a>, who guards a hidden vault under the city.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Fireball!</span></h4><p>As time goes on, the characters attract the attention of local factions hoping to recruit them while they settle into the city. Eventually, these relatively peaceful times are shattered when a fireball detonates near their new residence. The characters are swept up in the aftermath of this horrific event and can try to get to the bottom of it. Who cast the <i>fireball</i>&nbsp;spell and why? Who was the intended target? They can investigate the incident on behalf of a guild or a faction, or they can become involved for reasons of their own.</p><p>One casualty of the fireball is in fact its intended target: Lord Neverember's spy, Dalakhar. Whoever killed the gnome now has the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>, the key to finding the lost cache of dragons. One way or another, depending on the alliances—and the enemies—they have made in the city, the characters become embroiled in the chase for the stone and the hoard it protects.</p><hr><h2>Choose Your Villain</h2><p>When you run this adventure, you choose its main villain at the outset. Your choice determines the season of the year in which the story takes place, as well as the antagonists in several of the encounters in chapter 4, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWI4MDY3NmVmNDQy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Dragon Season</a>. The villain you choose opposes the player characters, while the villains you don't choose become part of the backdrop and could help the characters or hinder them.</p><p>As another unusual feature of this adventure, the villains aren't meant to be killed, nor are they out to kill the player characters. The villains are after a treasure hoard, and the adventurers' ultimate goal is to keep the treasure out of their clutches.</p><p>You can swap out one villain for another at any time. For example, if you decide halfway through the adventure that because of how the story has progressed <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkMzA3NzY2ZmMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jarlaxle Baenre</a> would make a better antagonist than <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzMyNGExNTJhZjA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Xanathar</a>, you can make that change on the fly and run subsequent encounters accordingly.</p><p>Each villain is fully described in their add-on and summarized below.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Xanathar</span></h3><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzMyNGExNTJhZjA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Xanathar</a> is a paranoid, megalomaniacal beholder crime lord whose goal is to wipe out anyone it perceives as a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTVjZTZjNWJmYTZl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Zhentarim</a> operative or sympathizer, retrieve the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>, and secure the cache of dragons. Its base is a dungeon under Skullport, a subterranean settlement beneath Waterdeep. This lair is described in the Spring Madness add-on.</p><p>Xanathar has a healthy fear of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWM1M2NkZmE0YmI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Laeral Silverhand</a> and is inclined to spare those in her employ, to avoid provoking a conflict with Waterdeep's Open Lord. Adventurers who incur the wrath of the beholder can use its fear of Laeral to escape certain death.</p><p>If you choose Xanathar as the villain, the adventure takes place in the spring.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">The Cassalanters</span></h3><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjgxY2IxOTdjYWJj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Victoro</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGJlMGU4MjUwODEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ammalia Cassalanter</a> are Waterdavian nobles and secret devil worshipers. The Cassalanters plan to use the cache of dragons to buy back the souls of their children, which they traded to Asmodeus for power. Their estate, Cassalanter Villa, has a temple of Asmodeus hidden underneath it, as described in the Hell of a Summer add-on.</p><p>The Cassalanters try to misdirect and discredit the characters rather than murder them. Victoro and Ammalia rely on their noble status to protect them, and the last thing they want is the City Watch on their doorstep.</p><p>If you choose the Cassalanters as the villains, the adventure takes place in the summer.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Jarlaxle Baenre</span></h3><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkMzA3NzY2ZmMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jarlaxle Baenre</a> is a drow swashbuckler and the secret lord of Luskan, the City of Sails. Jarlaxle plans to use the cache of dragons to buy his way into the Lords' Alliance, a confederation of cities and towns that band together against common threats. Jarlaxle also wants the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWZjODc0ZDQ3ODBh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</a></i> for leverage in his negotiations. In the magical guise of a human sea captain named Zardoz Zord, Jarlaxle runs a traveling carnival called the Sea Maidens Faire and lairs aboard a ship in Waterdeep's harbor that has a submarine (the <i>Scarlet Marpenoth</i>) underneath it, as described in the Meastro's Fall add-on.</p><p>Jarlaxle delights in thwarting his enemies, enjoys the complications that arise when adventurers try to meddle in his affairs, and loves to see the looks on their faces when he finally gets the better of them. He doesn't suffer fools who threaten him, however. If forced into a violent confrontation, he swiftly and brutally kills someone to make an example of them and then walks off.</p><p>If you choose Jarlaxle as the villain, the adventure takes place in the autumn.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Manshoon</span></h3><p>A clone of the wizard <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2NlZDg4MzUzMjUw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Manshoon</a>, one of the founders of the Zhentarim, is hiding in Waterdeep. He wants to rule the city, by claiming the cache of dragons and by using that wealth to bribe the Masked Lords into making him the new Open Lord. He also wants to regain control of the Black Network. Manshoon lurks in Kolat Towers, a pair of wizards' towers in the Trades Ward. This residence is described in the Winter Wizardry add-on.</p><p>Manshoon create&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTgxZDc5NTA3YzU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>copies of himself</a> using the <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Simulacrum#content\">simulacrum</a></i>&nbsp;spell and takes great pains to conceal his identity, since his success hinges on not attracting the attention of others who would seek to thwart him before his plans come to fruition. Manshoon avoids unnecessary confrontations with adventurers; only those who enter his extradimensional sanctum are likely to incur his wrath.</p><p>If you choose Manshoon as the villain, the adventure takes place in the winter.</p><hr><h2><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 24px ; font-weight: bold\">Seasons</span></h2><p>The adventure unfolds in a particular season depending on the villain you choose at the outset. If you switch to a new villain midway through the adventure, don't change the season to match unless the characters take enough downtime for seasons to change naturally.</p><p><h4><b>Faerûnian Calendar</b></h4>The Faerûnian calendar has twelve months that roughly correspond to the months of the Gregorian calendar. Each month has thirty days divided into three ten-day weeks (each week is called a tenday). Scattered throughout the year are five holidays that aren't considered part of any month. Once every four years, the holiday of Shieldmeet is added to the calendar as a leap day immediately following Midsummer night. Collectively, these days create a cycle similar to what we have on Earth: three 365-day years followed by a leap year.</p><p><b><i>Months.</i></b> The Faerûnian months are Hammer, Alturiak, Ches, Tarsakh, Mirtul, Kythorn, Flamerule, Eleasis, Eleint, Marpenoth, Uktar, and Nightal.</p><p><b><i>Annual Holidays.</i></b> The annual holidays are Midwinter (between Hammer and Alturiak), Greengrass (between Tarsakh and Mirtul), Midsummer (between Flamerule and Eleasis), Highharvestide (between Eleint and Marpenoth), and the Feast of the Moon (between Uktar and Nightal).</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Spring</span></h3><p>In Waterdeep, early spring tends to be cold and damp. Misty rain falls for days on end. It's common for fog to settle at night and last through the day. As the weather improves, the city attracts more visitors, and the streets become increasingly crowded as summer approaches.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Summer</span></h3><p>Summers in Waterdeep are quite comfortable, and it's a great time for citizens and visitors to congregate outside. The markets are busier than at any other time of year. Sometimes, though, warm air pushes up from the south and settles in the valleys north and east of the city. This air gets trapped, creating a hot spell that might last days or weeks. Activity in the city slows to a crawl, since Waterdavians are unaccustomed to such heat.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Autumn</span></h3><p>Throughout autumn, wagonloads of food arrive in Waterdeep from outlying farms. Without this bounty, city folk would starve during the winter. Cold, howling sea winds remind Waterdavians that winter is near.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Winter</span></h3><p>Waterdavian winters are harsh. As snow piles up around the city and ice fills the harbor, trade grinds to a halt and the city seals its gates. Citizens willing to brave the cold still gather in local taverns and festhalls, but few venture outside the city walls.</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/000_-_START_HERE/005_-_Introduction/avatar.png"}

A character who inspects the tracks and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check can tell that the deliverer visited both the shop and the alley residence. Before the characters can investigate further, they are assaulted by members of the Xanathar Guild.<br><br><p></p><h4>Bugbears Attack</h4>At the end of a dead-end side alley south of areas L1 and L2 (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzNmZWNkNmU0MWRm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Areas of the Alley</a>) is an iron grate that covers an opening to the sewers under the North Ward. Five<b> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGY0YWQ5YzhmY2E0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bugbears</a></b>&nbsp;have quietly climbed up through the grate and concealed themselves in the side alley. They pour out and attack the characters, hoping to gain surprise in the blizzard. Characters who have a passive Perception score of 16 or higher aren't surprised.<br><br>The bugbears were sent by Xanathar to retrieve a prisoner being held in the Zhent safe house, but they're too bloodthirsty to pass up the chance to murder a band of adventurers standing in their way. The wind and snow render the City Watch oblivious to the danger.<br><br><h4>Cuttle's Meat Pies</h4>Characters who speak to the proprietor of the meat shop, a portly middle-aged woman named Sora Cuttle (LG female Illuskan human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b>), learn that she received an unexpected delivery from Justyn Rassk of the Guild of Butchers. Given that fresh meat is in short supply in winter, Sora could hardly turn it down. If the characters see fit to tell her that the meat came from chopped-up humanoids, Sora falls ill. She has no knowledge of Thrakkus's nasty handiwork and promises to bring the matter to the attention of the Guild of Butchers and the local magister. Until then, she won't use any of Thrakkus's meat to make her famous meat pies.<br><br>Sora is suspicious of her two neighbors in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzNmZWNkNmU0MWRm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area L1</a>. They come and go at strange hours, sometimes returning from a night's sojourn with blood on their leather armor. If the characters do Sora the courtesy of warning her about the meat, she happily shares her concerns about her naughty neighbors, along with descriptions of them. One is a pale, gaunt woman in her twenties with dark, stringy hair. The other is a much older, dark-skinned man with a bald head, a half-missing ear, and a short white beard.<br><br><h4>Zhentarim Safe House</h4>This windowless house is occupied by two Zhents loyal to Manshoon—the same individuals that Sora describes. Their names are Avareen Windrivver (LE female Illuskan human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Njk2ZmFjZTg1NTU4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>spy</a></b>) and Zorbog Jyarkoth (NE male Turami human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjOTkwZDcyZDUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>thug</a></b>).<br><br>When the characters first enter the alley, Avareen is in the front doorway of the house, handing the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> to a high-ranking Zhent named Vevette Blackwater (CE female Tethyrian human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWVkYjViNmM0MWEz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swashbuckler</a></b>). Zorbog is stoking a fire in the fireplace while quietly observing the transaction. With stone in hand, Vevette scrambles up to the rooftops, leaving Avareen and Zorbog to deal with the survivors of the conflict between the characters and the bugbears.<br><br>Gagged and tied to a chair in the back room of the house is a known member of the Xanathar Guild—a shield dwarf who wears a leather skullcap stitched with fake beholder eyestalks. The dwarf, Ott Steeltoes, was captured while buying fish food in a Dock Ward market. After the Zhents interrogated Ott, it became clear to them that Xanathar would want him back. He is being held until a ransom is paid, but Xanathar has learned where he is being kept. Any bugbears that survived the initial attack try to rescue Ott, while Avareen and Zorbog do their best to fight them off. If Ott is set free, he runs back to the waiting eyestalks of his insane beholder master. Characters who follow him are led straight to Xanathar's lair.<br><br><h4>Next Encounter</h4>Any characters within 10 feet of the Zhents' front door can make a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check. Those who succeed on the check hear a mocking laugh above the howling wind and glimpse a cloaked figure on a nearby roof, darting away through the blizzard. If the characters chase after this figure, proceed with encounter 5, Rooftop Chase.<p></p></section>","img":""}

Wealthy guests begin to arrive in the late afternoon and gather inside the villa, away from the sun and heat, while one hundred of Waterdeep's poorest residents—most brought from the Field Ward—gather under pavilions set up on the lawn. Hired actors dressed as Waterdeep's founders parade around, and bards play lively tunes. No one suspects that the food in the pavilion tents has been laced with midnight tears—a poison that will slay the impoverished guests at the stroke of midnight. Ammalia is immune to poison and thus partakes freely of the delicious food. Wealthy guests who remain holed up in Cassalanter Villa eat and drink at separate tables and are spared a grisly end.<br></span><br>An hour before midnight, the entertainers disperse as Ammalia begins making toasts to her wealthy guests, turning them into unwitting accomplices by virtue of their presence and thus ensuring their silence. Meanwhile, house guards prevent any of the rabble from leaving, forcibly detaining anyone who tries to flee. Unless the characters prevent the poor folk from eating the tainted food, those attendees consume the poison and perish at the stroke of midnight.<br><br>While Ammalia plays host, Victoro instructs his cultists to remove the sacks of gold from House Cassalanter's vault (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZjUyMmMwYjY3MWU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area C29</a>) and hurl them into the sacrificial bowl (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGIzZDQyODIwNjFm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area A7</a>). They finish shortly before midnight. At the stroke of midnight, as the poison does its work, Ammalia keeps an eye on her wealthy guests and orders Tessina Khyret to notify Victoro that the deed is done. Standing before the statue of Asmodeus in the temple, Victoro summons a<b>&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDIxY2M5MTNmZGRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>barbed devil</a></b> and informs it that payment has been made in full. The devil declares (in Infernal) that the payment is “satisfactory” and informs Victoro that the souls of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGFmN2YyNzhlODY0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Terenzio</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzA3Yzg1MTA3NDgy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Elzerina</a> will not be taken to the Nine Hells.

It bears a striking similarity to the automatons that sometimes march in the Day of Wonders parade, as anyone who has lived in Waterdeep during the fall season knows. Because the Day of Wonders parade is sponsored by the local temple of Gond, characters might want to visit the temple and investigate a possible connection.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">House of Inspired Hands</span></h3><p>The House of Inspired Hands, Waterdeep's temple of Gond, sits on the corner of Seawatch Street and Shark Street in the Sea Ward. If the characters visit the temple, they see the following:</p><blockquote><p>The House of Inspired Hands looks like a cross between a temple and a workshop. The symbol of Gond, a toothed cog with four spokes, is displayed prominently. You see the silhouette of a humanoid shape perching on the rooftop. It extends an arm, releasing a tiny metal sparrow into the sky. The bird does a few loops in the air, then veers right toward you.</p></blockquote><p>The creature atop the temple is Nim, a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjZWI0MzEyNTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>nimblewright</a></b>. Nim was given to the temple as a gift from a visiting Lantanese wizard and has been creating its own inventions on the sly. One of those inventions was the nimblewright that detonated the fireball in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzU2ZGM5ODNiOTc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Trollskull Alley</a>. Another less-dangerous invention, a mechanical sparrow, is on an accidental collision course with the party.<br></p><p>Have the characters roll initiative. Nim's mechanical bird acts on initiative count 10, has a flying speed of 60 feet, and starts 60 feet away from the characters. It has AC 15, 1 hit point, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. On its turn, it flies toward one party member at random and makes a melee weapon attack (+0 to hit) against that character. On a hit, the bird deals 2 (1d3) piercing damage as it slams into the character with surprising force. On a miss, it crashes. Either way, it's destroyed on impact.</p><p>After the attack, Nim withdraws into the temple's attic through a secret hatch in the roof and lies low, hoping the characters don't report the incident to the temple's acolytes.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Inside the Temple</span></h4><p>The temple of Gond is open and abuzz with activity during daylight hours, then closes from sunset until sunrise. At night, acolytes retire to their private quarters to work on pet projects.</p><h4>Hall of Exemplary Inventions</h4><p>The main hall of the temple holds two dozen marble pedestals. Each one bears a prize-winning invention or a miniature model of some other extraordinary creation. Among the displays are several that stand out:</p><ul><li>A 4-foot-tall working model of a clock tower rings at the top of every hour. It is made of wood, iron, bronze, and glass, with brass bells and delicate hands formed from solid gold.</li><li>A wooden flying machine has wings that flap when it becomes airborne.</li><li>A miniature model of a mechanical dragon turtle has a brass plate affixed to its pedestal that reads, “Big Belchy. Sank in Deepwater Harbor on the Day of Wonders in 1363 DR.”</li><li>A functional “waking helmet” equipped with small, articulated metal arms and hands that gently slap the wearer if he or she falls asleep.</li><li>A miniature model of a red submarine shaped like a manta ray has a brass plate affixed to its pedestal that reads, “The <i>Scarlet Marpenoth</i>. Lantanese submersible. Launched in 1489 DR.”</li></ul><h4>Meeting Valetta</h4><p>The characters are met by <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjIyYzA1YTRmMjk4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Valetta</a></b>, a dragonborn priest of bronze dragon ancestry, with these changes:</p><ul><li>Valetta is neutral.</li><li>She has these racial traits: She can use her action to exhale a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot line of lightning (but can't do this again until she finishes a short or long rest); each creature in the line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. She has resistance to lightning damage. She speaks Common and Draconic.</li></ul><p>If the characters mention the figure they saw on the roof of the temple, Valetta identifies it as Nim, a nimblewright that was gifted to the temple by a Lantanese wizard. If they describe the incident involving the mechanical bird, Valetta sighs and leads them up a spiral staircase to an attic that Nim uses as a lair—only to find the attic's door fitted with a new lock. Valetta doesn't recognize the lock or have a key to open it, but a character using thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A <i>knock</i> spell or similar magic also opens the door. Valetta won't allow characters to break down the door, but she does permit them to speak to Nim through the door. A character can persuade Nim to unlock the door with a successful DC 17 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Valetta grants advantage on the roll by strongly urging Nim to comply.</p><h4>Meeting Nim</h4><p>Nim understands Common but can't speak. It has developed a simple sign language that Valetta and other members of the temple staff understand. After the incident with the bird, Nim hides amid the clutter in its lair, but it emerges if the characters find their way inside or coax it into unlocking the door. If the characters ask about the other nimblewright, Nim admits (through gesturing to Valetta) that it built the other nimblewright to ease its loneliness. But then Nim's creation fled in confused terror a month ago, and Nim hasn't seen it since. In light of this revelation, Valetta angrily orders acolytes to remove Nim's tools and unfinished inventions from the attic, while she forces Nim to look on.</p><p><b><i>Nimblewright Detector.</i></b> Characters who search Nim's attic or watch the area as it's being cleaned out can find a 1-foot-long copper contraption with an umbrella-like metallic protrusion at one end. A <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NGViNGI3MTJmYzQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect magic</a></i> spell reveals an aura of divination magic around it. If asked about it, Nim tells Valetta that it built this device to find the errant nimblewright and tried to seek it out, only to discover that Nim couldn't leave the temple grounds. Once Nim explains how the <i>nimblewright detector</i>&nbsp;works, Valetta allows the characters to take it.</p><p>To activate the <i>nimblewright detector</i>, a character must hold down its trigger. When the activated device comes within 500 feet of a nimblewright other than Nim, the umbrella begins to spin, whir, and click. The spinning, whirring, and clicking accelerates as the distance to the target lessens, reaching maximum velocity and volume when a nimblewright other than Nim is within 30 feet of the device.</p><h4>Reward</h4><p>If the characters want to track down the wayward nimblewright themselves, Valetta says that the House of Inspired Hands will pay them 500 gp to destroy it. If they return with proof of its destruction, Valetta sees that they receive the promised reward and also offers them one each of the following nonmagical inventions:</p><p><b><i>Adjustable Stilts.</i></b> The stilts take 1 minute to put on or remove. They increase the height of any humanoid wearing them by 2 to 5 feet. Each stilt weighs 8 pounds and is 1 foot long when fully collapsed.</p><p><b><i>Backpack Parachute.</i></b> A humanoid wearing this piece of gear can deploy the parachute as a reaction while falling, or as an action otherwise. The parachute requires at least a 10-foot cube of unoccupied space in which to deploy, and it doesn't open fast enough to slow a fall of less than 60 feet. If it has sufficient time and space to deploy properly, the parachute allows its wearer to land without taking falling damage. Once it has been used, the parachute takes 10 minutes to repack.</p><p><b><i>Barking Box.</i></b> This metal cube, 6 inches on a side, has a crank on top. Using an action to wind the crank activates the box for 8 hours. While activated, the box barks whenever it detects vibrations within 15 feet of it, as long as the box and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. A switch on one side of the box sets the device to emit either a small dog's bark or a large dog's bark.</p><p><b><i>Matchless Pipe.</i></b> A switch made of flint is built into the bowl of this fine wooden smoking pipe. With a few flicks of the switch, the pipe lights itself.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Finding Nim's Creation</span></h3><p>Equipped with the <i>nimblewright detector</i>, the characters can search for Nim's escaped creation. A ward-by-ward search is the best approach, but let the players tell you how their characters conduct the search. Depending on where they go, the search could take days.</p><p>A character mounted on a griffon can complete a city-wide search in a couple of hours. To secure the use of a griffon, a character must either be a member of the Order of the Gauntlet on good terms with Savra Belabranta or a member of the Lords' Alliance on good terms with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTM2MDgyNjViNmYw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jalester Silvermane</a>. As it happens, a young <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWMxMWRkMjRjMTE0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>griffon</a></b> named Bonesnapper is being trained to serve as a mount in the Griffon Cavalry. If Savra or Jalester is inclined to help the party, the characters can arrange to meet the griffon and its trainer outside the River Gate the following morning shortly after dawn. (The griffon and its trainer normally reside in Peaktop Aerie atop Mount Waterdeep, but most civilians aren't welcome there.) To gain Bonesnapper's trust, a character must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. The griffon won't allow any character who fails the check to ride it.</p><p>Nim's errant <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjZWI0MzEyNTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>nimblewright</a> is in Gralhund Villa on Saerdoun Street, in the North Ward. It isn't, however, the only nimblewright to be found outside the House of Inspired Hands. If the characters decide to search the Dock Ward, the <i>nimblewright detector</i>&nbsp;starts to whir when it comes within range of a couple of the ships in port.</p><h4>Dock Ward Distraction</h4><p>Zardoz Zord, owner of the Sea Maidens Faire, has brought his three ships to Waterdeep. Two of these galleons, the <i>Heartbreaker</i> and the <i>Hellraiser</i>, are docked. Zord's flagship, the <i>Eyecatcher</i>, is anchored in Deepwater Harbor. Each of the three ships (described in the Dragon Heist: Autumn addon) has at least one <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjZWI0MzEyNTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>nimblewright</a> aboard.<br><br><b><i>Roll20 Note:</i></b> If you would like to play out this encounter on a map, the ships are located in the Autumn addon, and set up with the drow crew.</p><p>The docks are bustling and chaotic during the day, except in winter. At night, darkness provides sufficient cover for characters to approach the docked vessels unseen. If one or more characters are caught aboard a ship, the crew tries to corner them until the ship's captain can have words with them. The nimblewrights, they say, are “attractions and nothing more.” If the characters ask to speak to the owner of the fleet, a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Mjk0OGViOTEyZjIx ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>sending</a></i> spell is used to contact Zord, who invites the characters to dine with him aboard the <i>Eyecatcher</i>.</p><p><b><i>Dining with Zardoz Zord.</i></b> Characters who accept Zord's offer are shuttled by dinghy to his flagship, welcomed aboard by drow crew members magically disguised as attractive humans (see the Maestro's Fall add-on for more information), and led to the captain's dining cabin (area J10):</p><blockquote><p>The dining cabin is bedecked with golden filigree, the purple curtains festooned with silken tassels, the wood paneling scented with perfume. A magnificent feast laid out on golden platters sprawls atop a mahogany table of exquisite craftsmanship. Even the doilies are something to behold. Standing behind it all with wine glass in hand is a well-built, scantily clad man, his scarlet apparel designed to accentuate his trim figure and bountiful chest hair. A flashy rapier hangs from his stylish belt.</p><p><br>“Welcome aboard the Eyecatcher,” he says, flashing his pearly white teeth. “Zardoz Zord, at your service.”</p></blockquote><p>This dashing figure is none other than <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkMzA3NzY2ZmMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jarlaxle Baenre</a></b>&nbsp;magically disguised as Zardoz Zord.<br></p><p>The characters have piqued Jarlaxle's curiosity. He doesn't know much about them (yet) and wants to determine whether they pose a threat (they don't). To win them over, he shares the following information over dinner and wine:</p><ul><li>The Sea Maidens Faire, owned and operated by Zord, is a seafaring carnival based in Luskan that travels along the Sword Coast. It provides good, wholesome entertainment in the form of fantastic street parades.</li><li>The <i>Heartbreaker</i> and the <i>Hellraiser</i> are used to transport entertainers, wagons, and parade floats. The <i>Eyecatcher</i> is Zord's command ship and private yacht. All three ships are built for comfort and speed.</li><li>Zord visits the distant island of Lantan about once a year. During his last visit, he purchased four <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjZWI0MzEyNTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>nimblewrights</a> from a Lantanese wizard. He keeps two aboard his flagship, and one aboard each of the other two vessels.</li><li>When they're not marching in a parade, Zord's nimblewrights remain aboard his ships. “They're perfectly harmless,” he attests, whereupon a nimblewright holding a decanter enters the dining cabin and quietly refills everyone's wine glasses.</li></ul><p>If the characters mention the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>, Zord shrugs his shoulders in a manner that suggests he doesn't know what they're talking about. He also feigns disinterest in Waterdeep politics, saying, “Every city has problems, I suppose. My job as an entertainer is to make people forget about politics for a while.” Characters who are suspicious of Zord can make a DC 24 Wisdom (Insight) check. Any character who succeeds on the check senses that there's much more to him than meets the eye.</p><p>Jarlaxle owns a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTBiNzVhOGUyZGE1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>hat of disguise</a></i> but doesn't need it to hide his true form while he's aboard any of his ships. His disguise (and the disguises of his drow subordinates) can be dispelled only by destroying the ship's figurehead (see the Maestro's Fall add-on). If the characters somehow discern his true form, Jarlaxle gives the party a slow nod of his head, dryly says “Bravo!” and lets them make the next move.</p><p>When dinner is concluded, Zord bids the characters farewell and sees that they are escorted safely back to the docks.</p><h4>Drow Characters</h4><p>If the adventuring party includes one or more drow characters, Captain Zord pays close attention to what they do and say, but doesn't treat them any differently from the other party members.</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/003_-_Chapter_3_3A_Fireball/003_-_Nim_27s_Secret/avatar.png"}

Dressed in a suit, his hair unkempt, he floats in plain sight most of the time, waving his hands about in gestures of greeting and salutation. Locals are accustomed to his spectral form and his stock introduction: “Let not this harried visage diminish you, gentlesirs and beautiful ladies, for I am but your friendly host. What fine art have we wrought for you this day? Buy your tickets and behold! You shan't be disappointed!”<br><br>The ghost can engage in light conversation. It is bound to the theater because Malkolm Brizzenbright's soul couldn't bear to leave the place. If the theater were to close down, the ghost would haunt it still, perhaps becoming more deranged over time.

In the story, a young woman is brought to a castle by a count, only to fall in love with his younger brother, a man of faith. Her betrayal eats away at the jealous count. He murders his brother on his wedding day and pursues the bride, who hurls herself off the castle battlements in despair. The count is cursed by the gods and transformed into a creature of darkness, damned to live in his castle and feed on blood. A female cellist and two male violinists provide musical accompaniment.<br><br>The shivering audience includes thirty <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></b>.

The Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild is best equipped to handle the refurbishing of the basement and plumbing. Clean bedsheets are provided by the Launderers' Guild. The streets around the establishment are kept up by the Dungsweepers' Guild and the Loyal Order of Street Laborers. Meat must come from the Guild of Butchers; ale and wine from the Vintners', Distillers', and Brewers' Guild; and bread and pastries from the Bakers' Guild.

If the characters have unpaid expenses, subtract 1 from the roll for each 1 gp they owe.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Sample Guild Representatives</span></h3><p>Once it becomes known around the city that the tavern in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzU2ZGM5ODNiOTc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Trollskull Alley</a> is planning to reopen its doors to the public, the adventurers receive visits from guild representatives interested in the tavern's welfare. This section describes a handful of these representatives.</p><h4>Broxley Fairkettle</h4><p><i>Fellowship of Innkeepers</i></p><p>Broxley (LG male strongheart halfling <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b>) is a laid-back, law-abiding halfling with mutton chops and bushy eyebrows. Inns and taverns are few and far between in the North Ward, so he makes frequent visits to the characters' place to see how it's doing and to offer his well-wishes. If none of the characters are members of the guild, he strongly urges them to join “to avoid further harassment.” The cost of membership in the Fellowship of Innkeepers is included in the regular expenses outlined in the “Tavern Keeping Expenses” sidebar.</p><p>Broxley has long believed the tavern to be haunted and is glad to see living souls in it once more. While lamenting the burdens of being a father of nine, he is quick to point out that the characters' continued compliance with guild rules and regulations makes his rather difficult life “just a bitty bit easier.”</p><h4>Hammond Kraddoc</h4><p><i>Vintners', Distillers', and Brewers' Guild</i></p><p>Hammond (N male Illuskan human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b>) doesn't like adventurers, but he likes their coin. This effete, well-dressed man is always seen in the company of a young scribe, Jinny (NG female tiefling <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b>), who wears spectacles and silently records notes and conversations in a small book as Hammond speaks.</p><p>Hammond likes to stop by in the middle of the month to inform the characters of new spirits that the guild has to offer, and to give them a list of which ones to push hard. To test the extent of their willingness to cooperate, he chastises them for their current selection of beverages, even if he previously sold them those goods.</p><h4>Justyn Rassk</h4><p><i>Guild of Butchers</i></p><p>Dead-eyed, slack-jawed Justyn (NE male Illuskan human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjOTkwZDcyZDUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>thug</a></b>) grew up in the toughest neighborhood in the Field Ward and has the scars to prove it. The guild doesn't pay him enough for him to afford a residence in the North Ward, and going to that part of the city fills his heart with resentment. He darkens the characters' doorstep once a month to deliver a cartload of chopped meat for the tavern's larder. Although delivery fees are covered by the guild's monthly dues, Justyn always demands some extra coin for his service. If the characters don't give him a gratuity of at least 3 gp, he says, “Maybe next time the meat will be someone you know.” He lets the threat hang in the air, then departs.</p><h4>Ulkoria Stonemarrow</h4><p><i>Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors</i></p><p>Ulkoria (NG female shield dwarf <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjcxYzFjOWMxZWUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>archmage</a></b>) has defended Waterdeep with her magic more times than she can recall. She's known as “the Gargoyle” because her face is frozen in a scowl that frightens adults and children alike. No one knows where she lives, but it's believed to be underground, possibly a cellar or dungeon under one of the city's oldest estates. She uses teleport spells to enter and leave her home, and she's never seen without her <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTYzZjAyZGNkY2Fk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>shield guardian</a></b> close by.</p><p>A little known fact is that Ulkoria once owned the tavern in Trollskull Alley. She sold it to a family of shield dwarves, who fell on hard times and sold it to a woman who made it into an orphanage. “Turned out to be a hag who was cooking and eating the children,” Ulkoria recalls. The estate passed through several more hands in the years that followed. Ulkoria hopes the new owners make something good of it.</p><p>Anytime she passes through the North Ward, Ulkoria stops by the tavern for a drink and to check out the place while her shield guardian waits outside. If she doesn't like what the characters have done with the establishment, she keeps her criticisms to herself. The characters can hire her to cast <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=M2JjYTA0ZWZkMWM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>glyphs of warding</a></i> on the place, for which she charges 300 gp apiece.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Business Rival: Emmek Frewn</span></h3><p>Emmek Frewn, a salty northerner (NE male Illuskan <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b>), recently tried to buy the tavern in Trollskull Alley but was outbid by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWM5N2VjMGZkZWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Volothamp Geddarm</a>. Stung by the loss, he bought a smaller, less impressive building in the same alley and turned it into a pub, which he calls Frewn's Brews. If you decide to introduce Emmek as a business rival, choose an unmarked building on <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzU2ZGM5ODNiOTc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>map 2.1</a> to serve as the pub.</p><p>Emmek's family migrated to Waterdeep after its holdings in Neverwinter were destroyed by the eruption of Mount Hotenow in 1451 DR. The family struggled to make ends meet by tanning leather in the Trades Ward. After Emmek's parents died, his sisters took over the business and bought him out. He never liked the work anyway, and he particularly hated dealing with the League of Skinners and Tanners.</p><p>Emmek is on shaky financial footing because he has sunk most of his wealth into this latest endeavor. He's also in trouble with two of the guilds. First, he tried to save coin by fixing the roof himself, in defiance of the Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild. Then he offended a member of the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild by comparing the dwarf's beard to barnacles on a ship.</p><h4>Goals</h4><p>Emmek wants his pub to be the most successful tavern in the North Ward, and he wants the characters' business to fail spectacularly.</p><h4>Assets</h4><p>Emmek is stingy when it comes to certain kinds of expenses and foolish with his coin in other ways. He tends to spend a lot on big, showy items and cut corners on the little amenities. Because he doesn't have much coin to throw around right now, his plan to ruin the characters' establishment begins with borrowing some money.</p><h4>Plans</h4><p>Emmek secures a 150 gp loan from Istrid Horn (see appendix B). He spends 50 gp for the services of the Shard Shunners, a gang of halfling wererats with which he has had nefarious dealings in the past. He pays the halflings to hinder the characters' efforts while he works feverishly to manage his own business.</p><p>Four gang members have been assigned to work with Emmek: two males named Kelso Fiddlewick and Dasher Snobeedle, and two females named Danika Fiddlewick (Kelso's younger sister) and Brynn Hilltopple. These halflings are <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTI3ZGRhNzcxMzVj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wererats</a></b>, with these changes:</p><ul><li>Each wererat is Small and has 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points.</li><li>It has these racial traits: It can move through the space of a Medium or larger creature. It has advantage on saving throws against being frightened. It speaks Common and Halfling, and it knows thieves' cant.</li></ul><p>Emmek's strategy for ruining the competition and the consequences for putting it into action are summarized in the table below.</p><h4><b>Emmek's Plans</b></h4><table class=\"userscript-table userscript-table-bordered\"><thead><tr><th>Element</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Event</td><td>The wererats scope out the characters’ tavern in halfling forms and might try to get jobs there.<br></td></tr><tr><td>Event</td><td>The wererats plant morsels of food inside the characters’ place and bore tiny holes in the outside walls to attract rats, creating an infestation.<br></td></tr><tr><td>Action</td><td>Emmek spreads rumors that the characters’ tavern is rat-infested, which is why he didn’t buy it.

When she refuses to give up the stone, members of the Xanathar Guild try to take it by force (encounter 2, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGU2ZWQ2Mjc0ZmZl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Mistshore</a>”). After the characters defeat these attackers, they learn that Grinda told her rat familiar to hide the stone in her family's crypt in the City of the Dead. From this point on, the characters are followed by a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDk4ZTg3ZjFiYjJm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>gazer</a>, through whose eyes Xanathar can see. If this gazer is killed, Xanathar doesn't send another one to replace it.</p><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZmQ0M2Y2YzgwNmZk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Losser Mirklav</a>, a halfling necromancer, raids the Garloth mausoleum and takes the stone shortly before the characters arrive (encounter 4, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZjM1YzYxN2ZlMzJm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Mausoleum</a>”). As they emerge from the mausoleum, members of the Xanathar Guild attack them, believing they have the stone. A clue left behind in the mausoleum leads the characters to an old windmill in the Southern Ward and a pair of grave robbers (encounter 10, \"<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDA5MTM1YjEyMDI0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Converted Windmill</a>\"). Fearing arrest, the grave robbers point them to a cellar complex under the Trades Ward (encounter 9, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODJlMjQ1OTJmMzQx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Cellar Complex</a>”). When the characters arrive, they find Losser surrounded by foes and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTg2ZDU4OTJkMDM5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>kenku</a> working for the Xanathar Guild making off with the stone. A chase through the streets on or before Trolltide (encounter 3, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTAyZTdmZTM1OWJm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Street Chase</a>”) ends when the kenku, fearing capture, duck into an old tower (encounter 7, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTFkNTVhZGZkMDFi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Old Tower</a>”). If they are caught and confronted, the kenku hand over the stone.</p><p>The Xanathar Guild makes one last attempt to regain the stone (encounter 1, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWYwMTFiNDgxN2Jm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Alley</a>”). Any character who becomes attuned to the stone learns that the Vault of Dragons lies beneath a theater in the Castle Ward (encounter 6, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDA3OGU1MTNlYTE0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Theater</a>”).</p><h4>Weather Effects</h4><p>Until the encounter chain is complete, the following weather effects are in play.</p><p><b><i>Heavy Rain.</i></b> Heavy rain falls from noon until midnight.

Barnibus quietly takes charge of the investigation at that point, while Sergeant Cromley directs a force of twenty constables (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veterans</a></b>) to knock on doors and question locals.</p><p>Before allowing the corpses to be removed and taken to local temples, Barnibus inspects the scene closely and reaches the following conclusions, which he prefers to keep to himself but might share with other members of the Watchful Order:</p><ul><li>The gnome was running from armed pursuers, of which there were three. The third person who was chasing the gnome isn't among the dead.</li><li>The gnome and his pursuers were moving toward the tavern in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzU2ZGM5ODNiOTc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Trollskull Alley</a> (which Barnibus will soon come to realize is the characters' property).</li><li>Neither the gnome nor his pursuers saw the blast coming.</li></ul><p>Given these findings, Barnibus decides to question the tavern's owners and occupants, with Sergeant Cromley by his side as a witness and bodyguard. Specifically, Barnibus wants to find out the gnome's identity and whether he was known to anyone. The characters, having never met Dalakhar, have little information to offer unless they decide to lie.</p><p>Neither Barnibus nor Sergeant Cromley is quick to jump to conclusions. They both prefer to have ironclad evidence and testimony from reliable witnesses before making any arrests. Even though the characters are suspects by virtue of their proximity to the crime scene, it hardly seems plausible that they would unleash destructive magic so close to their place of business in broad daylight. Consequently, Barnibus intends not to take up too much of their time.</p><p>Barnibus and Sergeant Cromley refuse requests by characters to join the investigation. “That would introduce too many new variables into an already confounding equation,” replies Barnibus with a frown. “Trust in the Watch,” Cromley adds dismissively. Characters who seem truthful and honest can press Barnibus for further information by making a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, they nudge Barnibus into revealing what he has discovered, as outlined above.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Eyewitnesses</span></h3><p>Many other people witnessed the fireball without being caught in the blast. Three of them have important information to share. Any character who spends at least 1 minute talking to one of them learns what that person saw or heard. (No ability checks are required, since the eyewitnesses are eager to talk.)</p><h4>Fala Lefaliir</h4><p>Fala, the owner of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzU2ZGM5ODNiOTc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Corellon's Crown</a> (see area T4), relates the following information:</p><blockquote><p>“I was watering plants in the greenhouse on the second floor of my shop when the blast blew out some of the windows. Lucky I wasn't injured! Through the smoke, I saw a cloaked man take something from the body of a dead gnome, then start limping away. He was badly burned and casting glances over his shoulder, like he was afraid someone might be following him. He was headed toward the Bent Nail.”</p></blockquote><p>Fala saw <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWU2N2EyYjA0ZTU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Urstul Floxin</a> fleeing the scene with the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i> in his clutches. He circled around the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzU2ZGM5ODNiOTc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Bent Nail</a> (see area T2) on his way out of Trollskull Alley.<br></p><h4>Jezrynne Hornraven</h4><p>A Waterdavian born of wealth and privilege, Jezrynne was leaving the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzU2ZGM5ODNiOTc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Tiger's Eye</a> (see area T5), having just hired <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzUyZTljNTkyZDAz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vincent Trench</a> to spy on her philandering husband, when she witnessed the following:</p><blockquote><p>“I tell you, it was not a man. More like a puppet shaped like a man. A puppet without strings. It was on the rooftop. It hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion. I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!”</p></blockquote><p>Jezrynne doesn't know what the “puppet” hurled to cause the fireball. She took her eyes off the thing during the chaos and doesn't know where it went.<br></p><h4>Martem Trec</h4><p>This 12-year-old boy watched as his halfling friends perished in the flames. He didn't see much beyond that, but he found something important after the blast went off:</p><blockquote><p>“Right after the explosion, I ducked behind a rain barrel. Then I heard a ‘plop' and found this in the barrel.”</p></blockquote><p>Martem produces a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWE2OGNiYzA4OGI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>necklace of fireballs</a></i> with two beads remaining and a broken clasp. As it fled across a rooftop, the nimblewright accidentally yanked on the necklace, which came off, fell to the roof, slid off the edge, and plopped into the rain barrel next to Martem.<br></p><p>He doesn't know what to make of this object but was planning to keep it. A character can snatch it from him or convince Martem to relinquish it with a successful DC 8 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check.</p><p>Characters who withhold the necklace, and knowledge of it, from the City Watch are guilty of a crime in Waterdeep.

Xanathar thinks that the gold would be safer under its watchful gaze, but without the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>, it can't remember where the gold is hidden.</span><p></p><p>Before running this chapter, review the “Beholders” section of the Xanathar's stat block, particularly the section titled “A Beholder's Lair.” Within its lair, Xanathar has access to lair actions, and characters might encounter the beholder's regional effects as well.</p><p></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\">Characters who don't visit Xanathar's lair in the course of this adventure might have reason to do so in <i>Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage</i>. In that adventure, the characters are most likely to approach the beholder's lair from Skullport (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTc1NGRiZmEzNjZh  style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area X4</a> for details).</p><p></p><p></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\">As they explore Xanathar's lair, characters will see a recurring symbol that looks like a circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating out from its circumference.

Its neighbors are aware of the magical force field that surrounds it, and they can see light from <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZWIyNjY0MDNmM2Nm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>continual flame</a></i> spells spilling out of the windows, Despite these persistent magical effects, most folk believe the structure is abandoned. Others think it's haunted by the ghosts of the Kolat brothers. They're wrong, of course.<br></span><br>Manshoon posts no visible guards outside Kolat Towers, since he wants others to believe the site is abandoned. The evil wizard and his underlings come and go using teleportation circles inside the towers.<p></p><hr><p></p><h3>Force Field</h3>An invisible field of magical force surrounds and covers Kolat Towers. The field is paper-thin and stands just outside the outer wall of the estate, extending upward to contain the buildings in their entirety. Nothing can pass through the barrier, including air, fog, rain, and snow. Creatures that don't realize the field is there bounce off it, with birds especially prone to striking it. The ground outside the field is regularly littered with the tiny corpses of birds that broke their necks hitting it, and street cleaners come by every morning to sweep them up.<br><br><h4>Digging under the Force Field</h4>There are no openings in the force field, which extends 1 foot underground. It takes 1 hour for a character with a shovel to dig a hole deep enough for a Medium creature to squeeze through, going under the field to the other side of the towers' outer wall. Since Kolat Towers is surrounded by other buildings, there's a 75 percent chance that any digging attracts 2d6 members of the City Watch (<b>veterans</b>), who put a stop to it.<br><br><p></p><h4>Using Magic to Bypass the Force Field</h4>Characters can use magic such as a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZGJjYzhiZmNhMGM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>dimension door</a></i> or <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZGE4MGM5NTBjMGFh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>misty step</a></i> spell to teleport from one side of the force field to the other. A <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NTRjN2Y4ZDUzNjNl ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>disintegrate</a></i> spell or a successful <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODY4Zjg3NjhmMDkw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>dispel magic</a></i> (DC 19) spell cast at the field creates a 10-foot-square opening that lasts for 1 minute.<br><br><span style=\"font-family: inherit\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px\"><b>Destroying the Force Field<br></b></span></span>A magic rune in area K18 generates the force field.

Its rooms have 15-foot-high ceilings, with 7-foot-high doorways connecting them.</span></li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Climbing the outside walls without equipment requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.</span></li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Each of the doors in the towers, as well as the door in the outer wall, is made of iron-bound oak and has AC 16, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If a door is locked, it can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or it can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Manshoon, Manafret Cherryport, and Havia Quickknife have keys to the locked doors.</span></li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Windows have leaded frames and dirty glass panes. They are latched from within and swing inward on iron hinges. A successful DC 11 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens a window from the outside.</span></li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Unless otherwise noted, all areas are brightly lit by <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZWIyNjY0MDNmM2Nm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>continual flame</a></i> spells cast on wall sconces.</span></li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Some of the staircases in Kolat Towers are invisible.

A creature traversing stairs it can't see can move on the steps at half speed without any problem. A creature that moves any faster than half speed must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or slip, tumble down the stairs, and fall prone at the bottom of them.</span></li></ul><p></p><hr><p></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Areas of Kolat Towers</span><br></p>The following encounter locations are keyed to the Kolat Towers map.<br><br><h4>K1. Storeroom</h4>The outer door is locked from the inside, and the room has neither heat nor light sources. Crates stacked around the room are packed with meat, and bear the seal of the Fellowship of Salters, Packers, and Joiners.<p></p><p></p><h4 style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">K2. Dining Room</h4><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">This room contains the following features:<br></span></p><ul><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Three Zhents in black armor sit around a stone dining table, playing Three-Dragon Ante (a card game). The table is set with silver.</span></li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Eight moth-eaten banners hang from the walls. Each bears an arcane sigil that represents a different one of the eight schools of magic.</span></li></ul><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><b><i><br>Zhents. </i></b>The card players are Sidra Romeir (LE female Calishite human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veteran</a></b>) and two subordinates (LE male Tethyrian human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjOTkwZDcyZDUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>thugs</a></b>). Since the force field around Kolat Towers keeps out riffraff, Sidra assumes the characters are guests of Manshoon arriving for a clandestine meeting. If the characters give her no reason to believe otherwise, she and her thugs escort them wherever they ask to go. If it becomes clear that the characters don't belong in the towers, Sidra and her thugs attack. Combat in this area draws the attention of Manafret Cherryport in area K3, who investigates.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br>Sidra wears a <i>teleporter ring</i> (see <b>Teleporter Rings</b>).</span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br><b><i>Treasure. </i></b>Silverware on the table is worth 100 gp.</span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"></p><h4>K3.

He loves to cook, and uses his mage hand cantrip to cut vegetables. He assumes the characters are intruders unless convinced otherwise. Any ability check to do so is made with disadvantage, since Manafret knows that Manshoon would have informed him if guests were expected. If the mage suspects the characters are intruders, he surreptitiously pours a vial of assassin's blood into the stew before asking them to taste it and give him an honest critique. He then cries out to the guards in area K2 and attacks. Combat in this area draws the attention of the Zhents in areas K2 and K7, who investigate.<br></span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Manafret wears a <i>teleporter ring</i> (see <b>Teleporter Rings</b>).<br></span><br><b><i>Treasure. </i></b>A cupboard holds a dozen jars of herbs and spices.

Musty Library</h4>This musty room is situated at the bottom of the main tower, and it has no door on level 1. It contains the following features:<br><p></p><ul><li>A suit of dented plate armor stands in the center of the room.</li><li>Tomes are packed into built-in stone bookshelves, with a tall alcove above each shelf holding a gargoyle. (Two of these sculptures are living <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2RhNGUyYzk4YTJm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>gargoyles</a></b>.)</li><li>An in-progress game of Dragonchess sits on a marble table in a reading nook.</li><li>A stone staircase spirals up to area K6.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul></ul><p></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><b><i><br>Gargoyles. </i></b>The two real gargoyles are indistinguishable from the inanimate gargoyle statues in the high alcoves.

The cover is a false one, wrapping around a tome bound in dragon hide—a disguised spellbook that contains the following wizard spells: <i>arcane lock</i>, <i>burning hands</i>, <i>comprehend languages</i>, <i>counterspell</i>, <i>darkvision</i>, <i>dimension door</i>, <i>find familiar</i>, <i>levitate</i>, <i>sending</i>, and <i>unseen servant</i>.

Garbage-Filled Room</h4>This room is on level 1 of the outermost tower but isn't accessible from that floor. It reeks of garbage and has the following features:<br><ul><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Ankle-deep refuse fills the chamber.</span></li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">Black scorch marks stretch from floor to ceiling along the walls and the stairs, which lead up to area K10.</li></ul><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br>Manshoon's servants throw their garbage here.

Main Tower Landing and Ledge</h4>Level 2 of the main tower has the following features:<br><p></p><ul><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">A stone landing with no railings has a door leading to area K7 and a stone spiral staircase descending to area K4. An invisible staircase with no railings (see Kolat Towers Features) hugs the wall as it climbs from the landing to area K11.</li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">Across from the landing, a wide stone ledge protrudes from the northeast wall beneath a window. A pair of identical wooden chests sits atop the ledge. (One chest is real. The other is a<b>&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2I3YjUxOTA1YzFk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mimic</a></b>.)</li></ul><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><b><i><br>Ledge. </i></b>There's no easy way to access the ledge, which is 8 feet away from the landing and at the same height. Characters can try to jump onto the ledge, or they can hook a rope onto the railing on the level above (area K11) and swing across the gap. They can also use magic to cross. Anyone who falls off the landing or the ledge lands in area K4, 20 feet below.<br></span><br><b><i>Mimic. </i></b>A character who touches the mimic becomes adhered to it. The mimic attacks if disturbed or when a character inspects the real chest next to it.<br><br><b><i>Treasure. </i></b>The genuine chest is unlocked and contains thirteen items, each of which can be used as an arcane focus: two crystals (worth 10 gp each), an orb (worth 20 gp), four rods (worth 10 gp each), and six wands (worth 10 gp each).</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"></p><h4>K7.

Other furnishings include a pair of rocking chairs, a couch, and an ottoman.</li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">Mouthwatering scents rise from a staircase that curves down to the kitchen (area K3).</li></ul><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><b><i><br>Zhent. </i>Yorn</b> the Terror is reading a copy of <i>Volo's Guide to Monsters</i>, autographed on the title page by the author with an added note that reads, in Common: “For Yorn. I hope you find the orc chapter illuminating!”<br></span><br>Yorn values his own well-being above all else. He is initially indifferent toward intruders. If Yorn believes the characters aren't a threat, he's happy to chat with them about the inhabitants and the layout of Kolat Towers.

Apprentice Bedroom</h4>This narrow room contains the following features:<br><ul><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">Three single beds are bunched less than an arm's length apart beneath a staircase that leads up to area K12.</li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">At the foot of each bed is a wooden chest.</li></ul><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br>The Kolat brothers once took on apprentices, who slept here.

Inside each chest is a set of common clothes, a spare spell component pouch, candles, ink, pens, paper, and 3d6 gp. Each chest also holds a spellbook that contains all the spells its owner has prepared. In addition, Ered's spellbook contains <i>burning hands</i>, <i>knock</i>, and <i>lightning bolt</i>; Havi's spellbook contains <i>charm person</i>, <i>detect thoughts</i>, and <i>major image</i>; and Savara's spellbook contains <i>comprehend languages</i>, <i>phantasmal force</i>, and <i>phantom steed</i>.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"></p><h4>K9. Bridge and Walkway</h4>A wooden bridge connects the two towers 20 feet above the ground, and a walkway attached to the bridge encircles the outside of the outer tower. The bridge and the tower walkway lack railings. Their planks and stones groan and crack underfoot but are safe to walk on.<p></p><p></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"></p><h4>K10. Wizard Statue</h4>This level of the outer tower consists of a landing and a narrow ledge with the following features:<br><p></p><ul><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The landing is 10 feet square and is met by two staircases. One descends 20 feet to area K5, and one ascends 20 feet to area K20.</span></li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">The narrow ledge built into the southeast wall has a life-size statue of a bearded human wizard standing atop it. The wizard looks angry and is leveling a stone wand at the door to area K9.</li></ul><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><b><i>Statue.</i></b> The statue depicts Duhlark Kolat, and a detect magic spell or similar magic reveals an aura of transmutation magic around it. The first time a character steps onto the landing, the statue levitates 1 foot above the ledge and intones the following warning in Common:<br><br></span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">“I am Duhlark Kolat, the great wizard and master of this tower! How dare you invade my home! Leave at once or be destroyed by magic beyond your comprehension!”</span></p></blockquote>The threat is empty, but the statue continues to levitate for 1 minute before sinking back down to the ledge. The magic resets after 1 hour. While it is levitating, the statue can be easily pushed or pulled around.<br><br>Casting <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Dispel%20Magic#content\">dispel magic</a></i> on the statue while it's floating causes it to fall, topple off the ledge, and shatter in area K5 below. Anyone in that area when the statue falls must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage.<p></p><p></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"></p><h4>K11. Laboratory</h4>This room consists of a ledge connected to the levels above and below by invisible staircases (see Kolat Towers Features). One staircase descends 20 feet to area K6, and the other climbs 20 feet to area K15. The area contains the following features:<br><p></p><ul><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Shattered glass covers the floor, and a large wooden trellis table has been knocked on its side.</span></li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">A large empty cabinet dominates the back wall.</li></ul><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br>This laboratory has been picked clean by Manshoon and contains nothing of value.</span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"></p><h4>K12.

The staffs have the same statistics as flying swords, except they deal bludgeoning damage on a hit. If a fight breaks out in this area, the creatures in area K14 come to investigate.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"></p><h4>K13. Holding Cell</h4>The door to this room has a narrow, barred window set into it. The door is locked and trapped (see below). As the characters approach the door, read:<br><br><p></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">A raspy voice calls out from beyond the door. “If you be good, let us rid these towers of evil's stench. If you be evil, open the door so we may battle, and my eternal boredom can end.” Beyond the door's barred window, a gargoyle lurks in a stone cell, challenging you in a low growl. “Come on, then!”</span></p></blockquote><b><i>Trapped Door.</i></b> A <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Glyph%20of%20Warding#content\">glyph of warding</a></i> spell has been cast on the door, set to trigger when it is opened by anyone other than Manshoon. The glyph, which resembles an ornate letter M, can be found with a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The glyph targets the creature that opens the door with a <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:Blindness%20Deafness#content\">blindness/deafness</a></i> spell (save DC 18).<br><br><i><b>Lady Gondafrey.</b></i> Duhlark Kolat long ago trapped a magical experiment in this cell: a gargoyle that has been imbued with the personality of a human knight of Tyr (god of justice) named <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjczMjFmNzk5MTEz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Lady Gondafrey</a></b>. This gargoyle has an Intelligence score of 10 and an alignment of lawful good. It speaks Common, and its face looks more humanoid than gargoyle. Manshoon is amused by the creature, so he keeps it alive but locked in the cell.<br><br>If the characters free Lady Gondafrey, she offers to fight alongside them; however, she quickly turns against any character who exhibits cruel or unlawful behavior. She can offer helpful information about Kolat Towers, and she is familiar with both the layout of the towers and the current occupants of the place. She knows that Manshoon resides in an extraplanar sanctum accessible through a teleportation circle that his lieutenants can activate using special rings. The gargoyle doesn't know where the teleportation circle is located, nor does she know why Duhlark transferred her consciousness into her present form.<br><br>The gargoyle retains fragmented memories of the life of Lady Gondafrey, a native Waterdavian who served in the City Watch. After identifying Duhlark Kolat as a suspect in several local disappearances, she darkened his doorstep in 1379 DR, the Year of the Lost Keep. Annoyed by this invasion of his privacy and not in his right mind, Duhlark captured Lady Gondafrey, used a spell to meld her form with that of a gargoyle, and imprisoned her.<br><br>If the gargoyle travels with the party, roll a d10 each day at dawn. On a roll of 1, Lady Gondafrey's alignment becomes chaotic evil for 24 hours as the gargoyle's innate demeanor exerts itself. In this state, the creature tries to orchestrate the characters' deaths, going so far as to attack lone characters.<p></p><p></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"></p><h4>K14. Servants' Quarters</h4>This room contains the following features:<br><p></p><ul><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">Furnishings include four beds, a small table with four chairs, and tattered window curtains.</li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">Four Zhent <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjOTkwZDcyZDUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>thugs</a></b> relax here—one trying to rest, two others playing cards, and the fourth sitting on the edge of a bed, re-stringing a heavy crossbow.</li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">The thugs work for Manshoon and leap up to attack anyone they don't recognize as one of their own. A successful DC 17 Charisma (Deception) check convinces these Zhents that the characters are their allies.</li></ul><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> Resting in small piles and neat stacks on the table are 74 cp, 52 sp, 19 gp, and 4 taols.</span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"></p><h4>K15. Summoning Chamber</h4>This room is connected to the levels above and below by invisible staircases (see <b>Kolat Towers Features</b>&nbsp;above), one descending 20 feet to area K11 and the other climbing 20 feet to area K16. This area contains the following features:<br><p></p><ul><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">A 10-foot-diameter circle of runes has been drawn on the floor in blood that is now dried. Smoke billows from four iron braziers placed around the circle.</span></li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">Three <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzM1OGIwZjEyZGRl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>apprentice wizards</a></b> stand outside the circle, chanting an incantation. A <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWNkZDUxYjI3MzMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>barlgura</a></b> is slumped motionless within the circle.</li></ul><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br>The three wizards here are Manshoon's apprentices—Ered Payno (LE male Damaran human), Havi Termock (CE female Chondathan human), and Savara Firethorn (NE female Tethyrian human). Each wears a <i>teleporter ring</i> (see Teleporter Rings below). The magical incantation that the three are reciting has quelled the barlgura and rendered it unconscious. If any of them stop chanting, the demon awakes and becomes enraged, though it remains bound within the circle. Whenever it takes damage, the barlgura can attempt a DC 10 Charisma check. On a successful check, it breaks out of the circle and attacks any creature it can reach.<br></span><br>Freeing the barlgura disrupts Manshoon's operation, forcing the wizard to spend time and resources defeating the fiend and replacing slain underlings.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><br></p><h4 style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">K16. Construct Workshop</h4><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The invisible staircase from area K15 ends in front of a closed door. The door is unlocked and opens into the room, which contains the following:<br></span></p><ul><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Bits of clay, stone, bone, and metal litter the floor and cover a wooden table in the middle of the room.</span></li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">The floor creaks and tilts slightly when stepped on, and it can be seen to be detached from the walls. Two oversized iron clamps on opposite sides of the room hold the floor in place. Each of these rusty mechanisms is attached to an iron lever.</li><li style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">A wooden staircase once climbed 20 feet to the next level, but it has partially collapsed.</li></ul><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br>The Kolat brothers once crafted constructs in this workshop. The magical clamped floor was built as a precaution in case one of the experiments went berserk.<br></span><br>When a creature that doesn't work for Manshoon's Zhentarim enters this room without being escorted, the metal scraps on the floor fly together, forming a suit of <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDViZGUwN2ZjZTI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>animated armor</a></b> that attacks. When the armor is reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, it tries to pull one of the levers on its next turn.<br><br><b><i>Floor Clamps. </i></b>Pulling a lever is an action that causes both clamps to release the floor, which is then magically driven upward into the ceiling. Creatures standing on the floor are knocked prone and must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw as they slam into the ceiling, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The floor then settles a few feet below the ceiling, cutting off access to the stairs down to area K15 but leaving characters free to climb up the collapsed staircase to area K17. (The magical floor was designed to prevent a berserk golem from reaching the lower chambers of the towers, and potentially the city beyond, while the Kolat brothers dealt with it.) After 10 minutes, the floor descends to its normal level and the clamps lock it down again.<br><br><b><i>Partially Collapsed Stairs. </i></b>A creature can climb the stairs to area K17 with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the check fails, the creature falls 10 feet.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><br></p><h4 style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\">K17.

Manshoon chose to leave it here and instructed his lieutenants not to disturb it. It moves to attack anyone other than Duhlark who approaches within 10 feet of it. A character disguised as Duhlark (using the statue in area K10 as a model) can fool the golem with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check.<br></span><br>The golem stands on a pressure plate. When it steps off the plate to attack someone out of its reach, the weight on the plate is lifted, causing poison gas to erupt from the holes in the walls. When the trap triggers, each creature in the hall must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. The gas lingers for 1 minute unless dispersed with a <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:Blindness%20Deafness#content\">gust of wind</a></i> spell or similar magic. While the gas persists, a creature in the hall must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. The golem is immune to the poison gas.<br><br><b><i>One-Way Secret Door. </i></b>A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the secret door that leads to area K19.

When the characters arrive, Grum'shar is interrogating Floon Blagmaar in area Q7. His display of torture techniques is a ploy to impress his other guest: a mind flayer named Nihiloor.</p><p>All the doors in the hideout are unlocked.

Two passages continue on to the north and south. A stone door is set into the back wall of a stone ledge to the west.</p></blockquote><p>If the characters talk loudly or otherwise make a lot of noise here, the goblin sentries in areas Q2a and Q2b awaken and shoot arrows at them through the arrow slits. The slits provide the goblins with three-quarters cover.<br></p><h4>Secret Door</h4><p>A secret door in the wall of the tunnel that leads south can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Q2.

If Krentz is here, he's trying to explain that Zemk's approach won't work, and is telling him to plug the gap at the bottom of the door with blankets. Neither of them notices intruders right away unless the interlopers make a lot of noise.</p><p>Once combat starts, Zemk fights to the death. How Krentz reacts to the adventurers depends on how they treated him earlier. If they helped him, he gives them a chance to leave in peace, but he fights alongside Zemk if they refuse to withdraw. If the duergar is killed, Krentz flees if he can or surrenders if he must.</p><p>Neither Zemk nor Krentz carries any treasure.

Fire burns around the orc's clenched fist, and his victim cries and squirms helplessly beneath him.</p><p>Seated on a raised platform to the south is a nightmarish figure wearing black robes. It has large white eyes and rubbery purple skin, with four tentacles encircling its inhuman mouth. It cradles and gently caresses what looks like a disembodied brain with feet.</p></blockquote><p>The tentacled creature is <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmYzOTgxM2QxYzJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Nihiloor</a></b>, a mind flayer that is caressing an <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODU1MDI3ZjhiYTQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>intellect devourer</a></b>. Upon seeing the adventurers, Nihiloor rises from the stone chair, sets its pet down, and glides across the room, intending to leave through the double door in the west wall. The mind flayer expects Grum'shar and the intellect devourer to cover its escape.<br></p><p>Nihiloor carries a 3-inch-diameter stone orb carved to resemble an eyeball, similar to what one might see at the end of a beholder's eyestalk. This stone eye is the key to activating the magic portal in area Q11. The mind flayer uses it to return to Xanathar's lair (described in Spring Madness). It uses <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YWJlMzgyMWU1NzAz ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>dominate monster</a></i> to control someone who gets in its way and turns any such individuals against their allies.</p><p>The half-orc is Grum'shar, a low-end Xanathar Guild boss. As soon as his minions retrieved who they thought was Renaer Neverember, the half-orc begged Nihiloor let him witness the interrogation of the captive, not realizing until after he did so that he had mistaken the prisoner's identity. Grum'shar attacks the characters in the hope of salvaging his reputation. He is an <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzM1OGIwZjEyZGRl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>apprentice wizard</a></b>, with these changes:</p><ul><li>Grum'shar is chaotic evil.</li><li>He has these racial traits: When reduced to 0 hit points, he drops to 1 hit point instead (but can't do this again until he finishes a long rest). He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. He speaks Common and Orc.</li></ul><h4>Roleplaying Floon</h4><p>As a result of Grum'shar's torture, Floon Blagmaar has 1 hit point left. If he is healed by the characters, he is eternally grateful and shows his affection by hugging them. He stays close to them, trusting in their ability to protect him. If Renaer is with the party, he can shoulder the burden of protecting Floon.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>In a satchel, Grum'shar carries his spellbook, which contains the following spells: <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YjBlMzE2NDhkZWVh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>burning hands</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NGJjYTFhMGZhYzZi ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>disguise self</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MjE1NGNlMGI0NWI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>false life</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=M2VhMTBlMDlmNzc3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>shield</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZWFmNDYzM2Y4YTA1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>unseen servant</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells%3AWitch%20Bolt\">witch bolt</a></i>.</p><p>Tucked behind the stone chair is a small, unlocked wooden chest containing two potions of healing, 16 gp, 82 sp, and 250 cp.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Q8. Getaway Passage</span></h3><p>This room looks empty, but a thorough search accompanied by a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a rough-hewn tunnel hidden beneath a loose flagstone. The low tunnel leads north to area Q9.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Q9. Private Cellar</span></h3><p>An innocent halfling family, the Peabodys, brews beer in this cellar, which lies beneath their home on Fishgut Alley in the Dock Ward. Their cellar contains brewing supplies and lots of worthless clutter.</p><p>The halflings haven't noticed the secret tunnel that leads to the Xanathar Guild hideout; it's concealed beneath a large flagstone that requires a Strength score of 10 or higher to be lifted.</p><h4>Development</h4><p>If the characters ascend out of the cellar and enter the Peabodys' small house, the halflings are initially alarmed but can be easily calmed. Upon learning of the secret trapdoor, they vow to seal it up again but allow the characters to make use of it if the need arises.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Q10. Sleeping Quarters</span></h3><p>Straw pallets lie on the floor, and rusty manacles are bolted to the walls.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Q11. Back Door</span></h3><p>This hideout contains a secret route to Xanathar's lair.</p><blockquote><p>In the middle of this otherwise empty room is a stone pillar carved with a small symbol: a perfect circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating outward from its circumference. In the middle of this circle is a smaller circular indentation that bears a passing resemblance to a lidless eye.</p></blockquote><p>If the stone eye in Nihiloor's possession is pressed into the circular indentation, an opaque black doorway magically opens in the south wall. The opening is 8 feet tall and 4 feet wide. Any creature that passes through it appears in area X22 of Xanathar's lair. The door is a one-way portal, and it closes again 1 minute after the stone eye is removed from the pillar.<br></p><h4>Not-So-Secret Door</h4><p>The secret door is plainly visible to anyone who approaches it from the east.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Q12. Hostel Cellar</span></h3><p>A narrow passage leads to the cellar of a halfling-owned hostel on Spices Street in the Dock Ward. Medium characters must squeeze to reach this area from the tunnel. The hostel is used as a base by the Shard Shunners, a gang of halfling wererats. They are aware of the Xanathar Guild hideout, and the two gangs are tenuous allies.</p><p>Roscoe Underbough, a Shard Shunner in hybrid form, guards the cellar. He hides in the northwest storeroom, ready to jump out and scare away anyone who heads for the stairs. Not eager to commit murder, Roscoe allows retreating characters to flee back to the sewers. He is a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzAyYmMwNjcyNWZj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>halfling&nbsp;wererat</a></b>.</p><h4>Development</h4><p>If the characters defeat Roscoe or slip past him, they can make their way up into the hostel, which caters to a mostly halfling clientele. With none of the other Shard Shunners currently present, the characters are greeted warmly by staff and patrons, who point them in the direction of the nearest bathhouse.</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/001_-_Chapter_1_3A_A_Friend_in_Need/003_-_Xanathar_Guild_Hideout/avatar.png"}

The chase plays out as a “theater of the mind” experience. Consequently, you don't need a map to run the encounter.

The chase takes place on crowded streets, in front of agog spectators.<br><br>If you haven't been tracking the distance between the doppelganger and the characters, assume the characters are 120 feet away from their quarry at the start of the chase if Willifort is traveling by hire-coach, or 60 feet away if the doppelganger is on foot. The hire-coach has an initiative modifier of +0, and Willifort moves with it. A creature in the hire-coach doesn't need to roll on the Urban Chase Complications table on its turn.<br><br><h4>Crowded Street</h4>If Willifort flees in a hire-coach, his getaway is thwarted on the third round of the chase when a large crowd blocks the road, forcing the hire-coach to stop. (If the chase occurs on Founders' Day, the crowd is part of the holiday celebration.) The doppelganger jumps out of the hire-coach on his next turn and makes his way through the crowd on foot.<br><br>Any creature in the crowd has half cover, and any attack that misses the creature because of the cover hits an innocent <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b> instead.<br><br>If Willifort is incapacitated, a raven abrubtly swoops down, acting next in the initiative count. It snatches the stone and flees with it. This raven is a shapechanged<b>&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjI0YWU4ZTU1ZDg1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>imp</a>&nbsp;</b>that works for Lady Cassalanter.<br><br><h4>Street Urchins</h4>The chase ends when three street urchins (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmE0MWYyNTFhNDI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Nat</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTE4ZTQ4ZjgzY2Ji ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jenks</a>, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzEyMTdiNjE2YTYz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Squiddly</a>) steal the stone, either by pickpocketing it from the doppelganger or by shooting a toy arrow at the raven and causing it to drop the stone.<br><br>Once they have the stone, the street urchins quickly lose themselves in the crowd. If Willifort the doppelganger is still around, he tries to slip away, believing he still has the stone. The imp, if present, turns invisible and circles above the crowd in a futile attempt to find the stone.<br><br>A character can use an action to search the crowded street by making a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check. On a successful check, the character spots an iron grate in the street that wasn't closed properly. Lifting it reveals an iron ladder that descends 10 feet to an underground sewer tunnel. Characters who lower themselves into the tunnel can hear the sounds of splashing water and children's voices in the distance and might decide to follow them. (The children are holding hands in the dark and being guided by Squiddly, who has darkvision.)<br><br><h4>Next Encounter</h4>If the characters follow the street urchins into the sewer, proceed with encounter 9, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjM4ODdjMWI1NTNi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Cellar Complex</a>.<p></p></section>","img":""}

She and her acolytes reside in Yellowspire, a Castle Ward tower so named because its bricks have a pale yellow tinge to them. Amath is in the midst of converting the tower into a temple of Bane. A teleportation circle in the basement allows for swift transport to and from Kolat Towers and Manshoon's extradimensional sanctum.<br></span><br><h4>House of Tyranny</h4>Amath Sercent (LE female Mulan <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTUxNTA4ZTNjY2M3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>priest</a></b>) and her four followers (LE male and female <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODM0ZGYwOTU1MjRh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>acolytes</a></b> of mixed ethnicities) dress in common clothing when outside the tower. Inside the structure, they wear fur-lined robes to stay warm. They refer to the tower as the House of Tyranny, and black prints of their right hands, with fingers and thumb held together, cover every interior surface. These handprints mimic the symbol of Bane.<br><br>Amath and her followers assemble here for worship but sleep elsewhere. When the characters first arrive, all five have gathered in prayer on the upper floor of the tower (area O3). Three black flying snakes nest in the rafters and join any battle here. During this ceremony, Amath and her acolytes hold candles and form a circle around a gagged and blindfolded broadsheet publisher named Shan Chien (N male Shou human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b>). The imperious, middle-aged man is shackled to the floor, and Amath carries the key to the shackles. The shackles can be broken by a creature that uses an action to make a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Picking the shackles' lock requires thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.<br><br>The Banites' ritual is designed to break Shan's will, making him subservient to Bane. Amath has been using this ritual to “turn” broadsheet publishers as part of a larger plot to control the flow of information in the city—a critical element of Manshoon's takeover. Shan was abducted by Amath's acolytes the night before while walking to his home in the Trades Ward. He publishes The Targe, a broadsheet that offers up vitriolic rants on all manner of local topics, including politics.<br><br>Amath has the <i>Stone of Golorr </i>in her pocket. She is expecting Manshoon or his simulacrum to arrive and retrieve it shortly.<br><br><h4>Outer Scaffolding</h4>The tower is encircled by wooden scaffolding covered with ice and snow. Despite its precarious appearance, the scaffolding is secure and safe to walk on, enabling creatures to scale the outside of the tower without having to make ability checks. The scaffolding rattles and creaks, however, and any creature that moves on it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity (Stealth) check or be heard by the tower's occupants.<br><br><h4>Simulacrum</h4>The characters must fight Amath and her acolytes to get the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>. When they finally obtain it, fate deals them an unkind hand as&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTgxZDc5NTA3YzU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Manshoon's simulacrum</a> arrives by way of the teleportation circle in area O5. If the characters had the opportunity and the foresight to destroy the circle prior to obtaining the stone, the simulacrum instead must travel to Yellowspire on foot, giving the characters ample time to get away before it arrives as long as they leave within 1 hour after obtaining the stone. The simulacrum tirelessly pursues the stone, and characters who flee would do themselves well not to leave tracks in the snow.<br><br><h4>Next Encounter</h4>If a character becomes attuned to the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>, it reveals the location of the Vault of Dragons, under the Brandath family mausoleum in the City of the Dead, and the three keys needed to enter it. When the characters are ready to visit the mausoleum, proceed with encounter 4, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NmQ0NGU2ZjhjOGNi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Mausoleum</a>.</p></section>","img":""}

If it occurs to none of the characters, an NPC suggests that the party visit the House of Inspired Hands to see whether the priests of Gond know a way to find it (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MjE3MjQxNmJhODcz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Nim's Secret</a>”).

The stone doesn't want to be found too easily, though.</p><p>If the characters obtain the stone earlier than expected, it proves uncooperative and tries to separate itself from the party as quickly as possible, refusing to share any knowledge with characters in the meantime. The stone tries to take control of anyone who attunes to it, triggering a conflict (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTdjYTM2YzA5OTA1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Sentient Magical Items</a>” from the&nbsp;<i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>). If the stone fails to take control, it can't try again against that character until the next dawn. If the stone succeeds in taking control of its owner, it orders that character to deliver it to whichever location sets into motion the sequence of encounters discussed in this chapter (see each add-on's encounter chain handout). Once the stone divests itself of its current owner, it tries to erase all knowledge of itself from that character's mind (see&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>the item's description</a>). Any player whose character is forced to forget about the stone carries the burden of roleplaying that memory loss. You can award inspiration to that character as a way to acknowledge the player's good roleplaying.</p><p>As chapter 4 unfolds, you decide when it's time for the characters to have a chance of securing the&nbsp;<i>Stone of Golorr</i>. Try to keep it out of their hands for as long as possible to maximize the suspense.</p><p>Once the characters have earned the&nbsp;<i>Stone of Golorr</i>, it no longer tries to take control of them. A character can attune to it and learn the following information:</p><ul><li>The location of the Vault of Dragons (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTBlMmQ4MDkyYWU5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vault of Dragons</a>”)</li><li>The three keys required to unlock the vault's doors (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmY1YWJiOTk4MjY0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vault Keys</a>”)</li><li>The name of the vault's gold dragon guardian, and the powers of the staff in its possession (see the description of the&nbsp;<i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWZjODc0ZDQ3ODBh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</a></i>)</li></ul></section>","img":""}

He dropped off a lady friend, a priest of Bane allied with the Zhentarim, and left the stone with her and her acolytes for safekeeping.

Renown is a numerical value that starts at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and reputation within a particular organization. You can tie benefits to a character's renown, including ranks and titles within the organization and access to resources.<p></p><p>A player tracks renown separately for each organization his or her character is a member of. For example, an adventurer might have 5 renown within one faction and 20 renown within another, based on the character's interaction with each organization over the course of the campaign.</p><p><br></p><h4>Gaining Renown&nbsp;</h4>A character earns renown by completing missions or quests that serve an organization's interests or involve the organization directly. You award renown at your discretion as characters complete these missions or quests, typically at the same time you award experience points.&nbsp;<p></p><p>Advancing an organization's interests increases a character's renown within that organization by 1. Completing a mission specifically assigned by that organization, or which directly benefits the organization, increases the character's renown by 2 instead. For example, characters with connections to the noble Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. Because the order likes to punish evildoers, you might increase each character's renown within the order by 1. Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission given to the adventurers by a senior member of the order, completing the task might instead increase each character's renown by 2, showing the adventurers as effective allies.</p><p>Meanwhile, the party's rogue might have looted a box of rare poisons from the dragon's hoard and sold it to a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might increase the rogue's renown within the Zhentarim by 2 since this action directly increased that group's power and wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an agent of the Zhentarim.</p><p><br></p><h4>Benefits of Renown&nbsp;</h4>The benefits of increasing renown within an organization can include rank and authority, friendly attitudes from members of the organization, and other perks.<p></p><p><b style=\"font-style: italic\">Rank.</b>&nbsp;Characters can earn promotions as their renown increases. You can establish certain thresholds of renown that serve as prerequisites (though not necessarily the only prerequisites) for advancing in rank, as shown in the Examples of Faction Ranks table. For example, a character might join the Lords' Alliance after earning 1 renown within that organization, gaining the title of cloak. As the character's renown within the organization increases, he or she might be eligible for further increases in rank.</p><p>You can add rank prerequisites. For example, a character affiliated with the Lords' Alliance might have to be at least 5th level before becoming a stingblade, at least 10th level to be a warduke, and at least 15th level to be a lioncrown.</p><p>You can set these thresholds of renown to any numbers that work for your game, creating appropriate ranks and titles for the organizations in your campaign.</p><p><b><i>Attitudes of Organization Members.</i></b> As a character's renown within an organization grows, members of that organization are increasingly likely to have heard of the character. You can set thresholds at which the default attitude of an organization's members toward the character becomes indifferent or friendly. For example, members of the Emerald Enclave—a faction dedicated to preserving the natural order-might be less friendly toward characters who have not cultivated at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming friendly by default only when a character has gained 10 renown within the Emerald Enclave. These thresholds apply only to the default attitude of most members of an organization, and such attitudes aren't automatic. NPC faction members might dislike an adventurer despite that character's renown-or perhaps because of it.</p><p><b><i>Perks.</i></b> Earning a rank within an organization comes with certain benefits, as defined by you. A character of low rank might gain access to a reliable contact and adventure leads, a safe house, or a trader willing to offer a discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked character might gain a follower (see chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, \"Creating Non-player Characters\"), access to potions and scrolls, the ability to call in a favor, or backup on dangerous missions. A high-ranking character might be able to call on a small army, take custody of a rare magic item, gain access to a helpful spellcaster, or assign special missions to members of lower rank.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Examples of Faction Ranks</b></p><table class=\"userscript-table userscript-table-bordered\"><thead><tr><th>Renown</th><th>Harpers</th><th>Order of the Gauntlet</th><th>Emerald Enclave</th><th>Lord's Alliance</th><th>Zhentarim</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Watcher</td><td>Chevall</td><td>Springwarden</td><td>Cloak</td><td>Fang</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Harpshadow</td><td>Marcheon</td><td>Summerstrider</td><td>Redknife</td><td>Wolf</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Brightcandle</td><td>Whitehawk</td><td>Autumnreaver</td><td>Stingblade</td><td>Viper</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Wise Owl</td><td>Vindicator</td><td>Winterstalker</td><td>Warduke</td><td>Ardragon</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>High Harper</td><td>Righteous Hand</td><td>Master of the Wild</td><td>Lioncrown</td><td>Dread Lord</td></tr></tbody></table><div> </div><div><div><b><i><br></i></b></div><div><b><i>Downtime Activities.</i></b> You might allow characters to spend downtime between adventures building relationships and gaining renown within an organization.

Keeping the characters in Waterdeep, where the action is, requires that they feel at home. To that end, here are some points to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Almost anything can be bought or sold in Waterdeep. There's no need for adventurers to shop elsewhere.</li><li>Waterdavians generally hold adventurers in high regard, given that many of the city's most esteemed citizens are former adventurers and that the city has been saved countless times by adventurers over the years.</li><li>Adventurers who are invested in the city are less likely to want to leave it. As your players flesh out their characters' backgrounds, encourage them to establish roots in Waterdeep. The adventure further invests the characters by awarding them property in the city and giving them opportunities to join local factions and guilds.</li></ul><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Breaking the Law</span></h3><p>Waterdeep is a city of firm laws and swift justice. Adventurers hell-bent on slaughter and plunder won't fare well in the City of Splendors. The punishments for assault, arson, theft, and murder are severe, regardless of the reason for the crime.</p><p>If the characters express interest in knowing more about crimes and punishments in Waterdeep, give them <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTg2ZjhhMjQ4NGIy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>the Code Legal</a> handout.</p><p>Characters who overtly engage in criminal behavior are quickly cornered and arrested by members of the City Watch. Those charged with committing a crime are brought before a magister to be judged. Advocates might intercede on behalf of the characters if they have allied themselves with influential NPCs and factions. For example, characters who become agents of the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTdkMTk2ZjhjODU4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Lords' Alliance</a> are more likely to be excused for crimes if <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWM1M2NkZmE0YmI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Laeral Silverhand</a>, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, has cause to let them off the hook.</p><p>Given how strictly laws are enforced in Waterdeep, it's possible that the adventure could end with one or more of the characters being exiled, sentenced to several years of hard labor, imprisoned, or put to death. If that's how their adventure ends, so be it. Hopefully, your next group will fare better.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Arresting Characters</span></h3><p>When the authorities show up to arrest one or more player characters for breaking the law, you can handle the arrest in one of two ways.</p><p>The first approach is to roleplay the encounter with the arresting officers of the City Watch. The benefit of this approach is that characters can choose to go quietly or resist. The drawback is that the encounter might devolve into a fight-or-flight situation, leading to one or more characters becoming fugitives. If the party includes one or more characters who aren't lawful, such an outcome is likely. To mitigate this drawback, you might allow fugitive characters to forge alliances with NPCs who can help clear their names.</p><p>If the threat of arrest becomes tedious, you can switch to the second approach, which is to merely inform the players that one or more characters have been arrested. You can describe the arrest, the subsequent detention, and the events leading up to the trial. The drawback to this approach is that player characters have no control over the situation. (This sense of helplessness has the virtue of being realistic, if not fun.) To mitigate this drawback, you might allow characters to make ability checks to influence the outcome; for example, a successful Charisma (Persuasion) check might enable a character to bribe an official or sow enough doubt in the mind of a magistrate to have the case thrown out.</p><p><b>Naming NPCs<br></b>Important NPCs in the adventure are given names, but many of the secondary NPCs aren't named. <i>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</i> contains an appendix of tables you can use to randomly generate names for human and nonhuman NPCs if you have trouble coming up with names on your own.</p><hr><h2><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 24px ; font-weight: bold\">Character Creation</span></h2><p>If your players are creating 1st-level characters for this adventure, consider setting aside the first game session for character creation. That way, the players can flesh out their adventuring party together and come up with reasons why their characters are friends.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Bringing the Party Together</span></h3><p>The Yawning Portal is a popular adventurers' hangout. Unless you have a better idea, assume that the characters are familiar with the establishment and have met there before. If any of the characters are new to the city, they can be drawn to the Yawning Portal by its reputation or summoned there by Volo.</p><p>To make the Yawning Portal feel like a familiar, welcoming place, give the players a copy of<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2I3ODAzN2QxZTE4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> the Yawning Portal Familiar Faces</a> handout and allow each player to select one NPC as a friendly acquaintance. Additional information about these NPCs can be found at the end of this introduction.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Buying Equipment at 1st Level</span></h3><p>All the equipment in chapter 5 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> is available for purchase in Waterdeep at normal prices.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Character Backgrounds</span></h3><p>Players looking for background options beyond those described in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> can find several appropriate ones in the <i>Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide</i>: City Watch, cloistered scholar, courtier, faction agent, far traveler, inheritor, mercenary veteran, urban bounty hunter, and Waterdavian noble. If you have access to this book, consider making its background options available to your players' characters.</p><h4>Waterdavian Noble Families</h4><p>Waterdeep contains well over a hundred noble families. The following noble houses are fine choices for any character with the noble background from the <i>Player's Handbook</i> or the Waterdavian noble background from the <i>Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide</i>.</p><p><i><b>House Amcathra.</b></i> The Amcathras are a Tethyrian family that specializes in horse breeding and training, cattle ranching, wine-making, and weaponsmithing. The family motto is “We trample our troubles.” The family has a large villa in the North Ward, on the east side of the High Road between Hassantyr's Street and Tarnath Street.</p><p><b><i>House Margaster.</i></b> The Margasters are an Illuskan family whose business interests lie in land-based shipping and bulk goods trading. The house also has a quiet history of wizardry. The family motto is “Nothing is beyond our grasp.” The Margaster family estate is situated between Stabbed Sailor Alley and Shattercrock Alley in the North Ward.</p><p><b><i>House Phylund.</i></b> The Phylunds are a Tashlutar family that captures and sells monsters. Monsters that can't be trained as pets or guard beasts are sold to arenas or harvested for their meat, bones, and skins. The Phylunds sponsor adventuring parties and monster-hunting expeditions, and their motto is “What you fear, we master.” House Phylund has an estate on Copper Street, west of the High Road between Julthoon Street and Trader's Way in the North Ward.</p><p><b><i>House Rosznar.</i></b> Once banished from Waterdeep for smuggling, slavery, and other crimes, this Tethyrian house has returned and is trying to overcome its dark past and disgraceful reputation by focusing on legitimate business ventures such as wine-making and gem trading. The family motto is “We fly high and stoop swift.” Rosznar Villa is situated on Thunderstaff Way between Copper Street and Shield Street in the Sea Ward, west of the High Road.</p><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjkyNDUwZWNjMzc3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Lady Esvele Rosznar</a> (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTRiNzAzYjEyNWM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Black Viper</a>”) is a member of this house, though she keeps her masked identity and thieving escapades a secret.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Guild Membership</span></h3><p>Any characters with the guild artisan background are assumed to have free membership in one Waterdeep guild of their choice. Arcane spellcasters living in the city are required by law to register with the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, so that they can be called on to defend the city with their magic in times of need.</p><p>Waterdeep's most prominent guilds appear on the Guilds of Waterdeep list. By law, there are no active thieves' guilds in Waterdeep, and the Xanathar Guild isn't an actual guild but a faction (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWY5NDY4ZTI2MTcx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Factions in Waterdeep</a>”).</p><p>To join a guild, one must possess a background, a proficiency, or a status that the guild values. For example, a character with the sailor background is welcome to join the Master Mariners' Guild. One can practice a profession and not be a guild member, but such autonomy carries a cost. The guilds do everything they can to entice new members to join and pay for membership, and they go out of their way to hinder independent business owners, up to and including driving them out of business. A baker who refuses to join the Bakers' Guild might find her flour supply cut off, while a wizard who refuses to join the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors might be denied access to sages, libraries, and other useful resources.</p><p>Guilds charge members monthly or yearly dues that vary. For simplicity, you can have a guild charge 1 gp per month or 10 gp for a year's dues paid in advance. A guild can expel a member for any number of reasons, not the least of which is failing to pay dues.</p><p><b>Guilds of Waterdeep<br></b></p><table class=\"userscript-table userscript-table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Bakers’ Guild<br></td><td>Launderers’ Guild<br></td></tr><tr><td>Carpenters’, Roofers’, and Plaisterers’ Guild<br></td><td>League of Basket-makers and Wickerworkers<br></td></tr><tr><td>Cellarers’ and Plumbers’ Guild<br></td><td>League of Skinners and Tanners<br></td></tr><tr><td>Coopers’ Guild<br></td><td>Loyal Order of Street Laborers<br></td></tr><tr><td>Council of Farmer-Grocers<br></td><td>Master Mariners’ Guild<br></td></tr><tr><td>Council of Musicians, Instrument-makers, and Choristers<br></td><td>Most Careful Order of Skilled Smiths and Metalforgers<br></td></tr><tr><td>Dungsweepers’ Guild<br></td><td>Most Diligent League of Sail-makers and Cordwainers<br></td></tr><tr><td>Fellowship of Bowyers and Fletchers<br></td><td>Most Excellent Order of Weavers and Dyers<br></td></tr><tr><td>Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen<br></td><td>Order of Cobblers and Corvisers<br></td></tr><tr><td>Fellowship of Innkeepers<br></td><td>Order of Master Shipwrights<br></td></tr><tr><td>Fellowship of Salters, Packers, and Joiners<br></td><td>Order of Master Tailors, Glovers, and Mercers<br></td></tr><tr><td>Fishmongers’ Fellowship<br></td><td>Saddlers’ and Harness-makers’ Guild<br></td></tr><tr><td>Guild of Apothecaries and Physicians<br></td><td>Scriveners’, Scribes’, and Clerks’ Guild<br></td></tr><tr><td>Guild of Butchers<br></td><td>Solemn Order of Recognized Furriers and Woolmen<br></td></tr><tr><td>Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters<br></td><td>Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, and Finesmiths<br></td></tr><tr><td>Guild of Fine Carvers<br></td><td>Stablemasters’ and Farriers’ Guild<br></td></tr><tr><td>Guild of Glassblowers, Glaziers, and Spectacle-makers<br></td><td>Stationers’ Guild<br></td></tr><tr><td>Guild of Stonecutters, Masons, Potters, and Tile-makers<br></td><td>Surveyors’, Map-, and Chart-makers’ Guild<br></td></tr><tr><td>Guild of Trusted Pewterers and Casters<br></td><td>Vintners’, Distillers’, and Brewers’ Guild<br></td></tr><tr><td>Guild of Watermen<br></td><td>Wagon-makers’ and Coach Builders’ Guild<br></td></tr><tr><td>Jesters’ Guild<br></td><td>Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors<br></td></tr><tr><td>Jewelers’ Guild<br></td><td>Wheelwrights’ Guild<br></td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Faction Membership</span></h3><p>A character with the faction agent background (described in the <i>Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide</i>) must choose a faction to belong to (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWY5NDY4ZTI2MTcx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Factions in Waterdeep</a>”). Characters without this background can join factions once they reach the end of chapter 1 of this adventure.</p><p><b>Tracking Renown<br></b>This adventure includes side quests available only to characters who join the factions described in this adventure. You can use the optional renown rules in chapter 1 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> to track a character's rank and ascent within a given faction. The <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> gives names for various ranks within the Harpers, the Emerald Enclave, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Zhentarim. Rank names for members of Bregan D'aerthe, Force Grey, and the Xanathar Guild are given below, with the renown needed to attain each rank.</p><p><b><i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YmY5NGQ5YWUwM2M5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Bregan D'aerthe</a> Ranks:</i></b> Orbb (private, 1), Kyorlinorbb (corporal, 3), Khal'abbil (sergeant, 10), Mallasargtlin (lieutenant, 25), Ilareth (captain, 50)</p><p><b><i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzhmMWZiOTI3MzYy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Force Grey</a> Ranks:</i></b> Gray Hand Initiate (1), Junior Gray Hand (3), Senior Gray Hand (10), Force Grey Initiate (25), Defender of Waterdeep (50)</p><p><b><i>Xanathar Guild Ranks:</i></b> Eyestalker (1), Agent of the Eye (3), Eye Ray (10), Guild Boss (25), Hand of the Eye (50)</p><hr><h2><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 24px ; font-weight: bold\">Character Advancement</span></h2><p>You can track experience points or simply allow characters to level up when they reach certain points in the adventure. Ideally, the characters should fall within the desired level range as they experience each chapter, as shown in the Suggested Character Levels table.</p><p><b>Suggested Character Levels</b></p><table class=\"userscript-table userscript-table-bordered\"><thead><tr><th>Chapter</th><th>Suggested Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. A Friend in Need<br></td><td>1st–2nd<br></td></tr><tr><td>2. Trollskull Alley<br></td><td>2nd<br></td></tr><tr><td>3. Fireball<br></td><td>3rd<br></td></tr><tr><td>4.

Maestro’s Fall<br></td><td>5th or higher<br></td></tr><tr><td>8. Winter Wizardry<br></td><td>5th or higher<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you decide to track experience points, you can slow the rate of advancement by banking XP until you're ready for the party to level up. Conversely, you can hasten level advancement by awarding ad hoc XP for completing goals, roleplaying well, and surviving or avoiding deadly traps. Any such award should be no more than what the characters would earn for defeating a monster with a challenge rating equal to their level. For example, a fair ad hoc award for a party of 2nd-level adventurers would be 450 XP, which is what the characters would earn for defeating a challenge rating 2 monster.<br></p><p>If you dispense with XP tracking and allow characters to gain levels as the adventure progresses, use the Suggested Character Levels table as your guide.</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/000_-_START_HERE/007_-_Life_in_Waterdeep/avatar.png"}
{"_id":"NDhjNTNiMGMzYTZh","name":"Encounter Chains","permission":{"default":0},"folder":"ZjkyNWQxOTIzZmJl","flags":{"R20Converter":{"handout-order":2,"handout-archived":false}},"sort":20000,"entryTime":0,"content":"<p><br></p>\n<section class=\"secret\"><p>GM Notes : </p><h2>Encounter Chains<br></h2><p>Eight encounters comprise the characters' hunt for the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i> and the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTBlMmQ4MDkyYWU5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vault of Dragons</a>. They form a chain, and their order is determined by your choice of villain and season. The diagram on the facing page illustrates the order of encounters in each chain. If <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzMyNGExNTJhZjA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Xanathar</a> is the villain, for example, the chain begins with encounter 2, “Mistshore,” and ends with encounter 6, “Theater.”</p><p>Don't feel bound by an encounter chain. Let the characters' decisions and actions drive the story. You can change the order in which encounters happen, remove encounters you don't need, or create new encounters. You can also modify encounters to suit your tastes.</p><p>If the characters stray, they might find themselves at a loss for what to do next. You have a couple of easy ways to guide them back on track:</p><ul><li>A friendly faction that has information about the whereabouts of the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>'s whereabouts can bring that knowledge to the characters.</li><li>A treacherous underling of the villain reveals the location of the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> for a price.</li></ul><hr><h4><b>If a Villain Gets the Stone</b></h4><p>If a main villain acquires the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>, it takes that villain 2d6 days to find the Vault of Dragons and its keys. During this time, the characters have a chance to steal the stone from the villain's lair. If the characters don't steal the stone in time, the villain sends forces into the vault to defeat Aurinax and recover the gold, which takes another 2d6 days. Once the gold is recovered, the villain moves forward with a master plan as detailed in the introduction. If the characters are still alive, they could oppose the villain by stealing the gold from the villain's lair.</p><p><h4><b>Modifying Encounters</b></h4>You can adjust the difficulty of a combat encounter by adding or subtracting monsters. If you need to increase the difficulty of an encounter that has already begun, have enemy reinforcements arrive during the battle. If you find an encounter too deadly, reduce the antagonists' hit points, have NPCs arrive to help the characters, or have the bad guys cut their losses and flee.</p><p><h4><b>The Three Urchins</b></h4>Three street urchins, described below, appear in several of this chapter's scenes:</p><p></p><p><b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmE0MWYyNTFhNDI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Nat</a></b>&nbsp;is a lanky, 10-year-old deaf Illuskan girl with a wooden toy sword.

The truth is, I want nothing to do with him. But his spies hound me. One of them, a gnome named Dalakhar, had been watching me for months. Then, about two tendays ago, the spy was suddenly nowhere to be seen. My father didn't trust many people, but he trusted that gnome.</p><p><br>“I spoke to a few of Dalakhar's friends. Apparently, he was on a special mission to retrieve the Stone of Golorr and was afraid that the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild were close to catching him. When he heard about my kidnapping, he wanted more information about the adventurers who had rescued me. I think Dalakhar was planning to pay you to deliver the Stone of Golorr to my father in Neverwinter.”</p></blockquote><p>Any attempt to follow up with Dalakhar's friends proves futile, since they have gone into hiding in the wake of the gnome's sudden demise.</p><p>If the characters tell Renaer that <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmQzNmJkMWQ1ZDEy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Fala Lefaliir saw a man fleeing Trollskull Alley</a> (see “Eyewitnesses”), Renaer reaches out to his friends in the Harpers.

You have in your hands the foremost and most up-to-date guide to the city—smiled over by none other than its Open Lord, Lady Laeral Silverhand. This chapbook will serve you well until my seminal work on the subject, <i>Volo's Guide to Waterdeep</i>—sadly long out of print, but now a tome prized by collectors—can be updated and printed anew. Ask any broadsheet seller, innkeeper, shopkeeper, tavern owner, or bookseller if they'll soon have copies of the new edition for sale!</p><hr><h2><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 24px ; font-weight: bold\">Entering Waterdeep</span></h2><p>Likely you have already arrived in Waterdeep and borne witness to some of its many wonders. But in case this pamphlet has found its way beneath your worthy eyes in anticipation of your visit, due to the commendable efforts of some friend or family member who loves you dearly, I shall explain briefly the circumstances of entry.</p><p>You will have traveled through lands claimed and controlled by the Lords of Waterdeep long before you see its walls. If you've come from the south by the Trade Way, you'll have met the City Guard at their post at Zundbridge. From the north by way of the Long Road, you'll have passed under their watchful eyes at the town of Rassalantar. And whether by land or sea, you'll likely also have been spotted by the Griffon Cavalry—even if you have not spotted them.</p><p>Worry not. Waterdeep is a welcoming city, and you have nothing to fear from these guardians unless you lead a rampaging army of orcs, a horde of gnolls, or similar. They don't even require a toll be paid. (Beware any City Guard who demands a toll, and report the incident to a magister of Waterdeep at your earliest convenience.)</p><p>If you travel in a large caravan or on a ship, you will be required to register with a magister at the gate at which you arrived or with the harbor magister. Magisters can easily be recognized by the black robes they wear (and, in fact, are commonly called “black robes” as a result) and the City Guard force that always accompanies them. Be aware that magisters can pass a sentence without a trial. It behooves you to treat them with proper respect.</p><p>If you travel overland in a small party or alone, you aren't required to register with a magister unless your stay extends beyond a tenday. At that point, you must register with a magister either at the harbor, the gates, or the city courts. Discovery of your failure to do so can result in a fine or forced labor. Of course, registration subjects you to monthly taxation. But as a truculent old acquaintance from the Dales once told me, “The sheep gives the shepherd its fleece or there'll be mutton for dinner.” That is, the magisters will get you either way, so you might as well register up front.</p><p>That said, many canny visitors with business for a month or a season betimes avail themselves of the hospitality of inns in Undercliff, the pleasant farmland east of the city proper. The less well-off often find accommodation in the Field Ward. Because neither are official wards of the city, they aren't subject to taxation. Note, however, that because both these areas have yet to be formally accepted as wards of the city, they don't benefit from the securities of Guild Law or the protection of the Watch. If you choose to follow this path, be on your guard. Fools rush in where auditors fear to tread.</p><p>Regardless of what size party you arrive with or by what means, if you arrive by night or in winter, expect to register. In winter and at night the gates are shut. Ships aren't expected at night or as a regular occurrence after the first frost of the coming season, and are often met at docking by a magister—or by a contingent of the Guard who will hold travelers aboard until a magister can be summoned.</p><p>None of these rules apply to the city's least used gate, the West Gate. This smaller gate opens onto the Mud Flats—a mucky beach used by clam diggers, shore fishers, and those brave enough to bathe in the cold waves. Those who make a living through fishing with nets or traps also use this gate, keeping their small boats on the beach to avoid docking fees. Locals register with the Guard as they exit and as they enter. No magister is stationed at the gate, but no new arrivals to Waterdeep are accepted here.</p><p>If you approach by air, expect a vigorous pursuit by and confrontation with the Griffon Cavalry. Only specially licensed individuals and mounts can fly over Waterdeep. It is best to land well outside the city and approach on foot.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Your Arrival in the City</span></h3><p>The splendors that await you in Waterdeep are legendary. Each of the city's wards is detailed in this work, telling you what to expect depending on where you are, as well as what thrilling things you might see and do. Before that, however, there are the small matters of knowing something of the history of the place you visit, and of understanding how to comport yourself in the Sword Coast's grandest metropolis.</p>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/005_-_Volo_27s_Waterdeep_Enchiridion/001_-_Welcome_2C_Traveler_21/avatar.png"}

A fire swept through the area a little over a year ago, and most of the buildings are now burned-out shells with (at best) sails for roofs.

Multiply the total of the check by 10 to determine the gold piece value of any treasure found. Grinda sells the bounty and gives half to the characters.<br><br>As the characters search the harbor for treasure, roll any die.

The drow prefer to take captives or render enemies unconscious rather than kill them. Captives are thrown in the brig (area J15) until Jarlaxle decides what to do with them, and their gear is stowed in the armory (area J16).</p><p><br></p><h4>Ceilings</h4><p>Cabins, holds, and passageways have 8-foot-high ceilings with 6-foot-high doorways connecting them.</p><p><br></p><h4>Doors</h4><p>Unless otherwise noted, doors are made of wood. A door's lock can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or a door can be forced open by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. A ship's captain has keys to all locked doors aboard his vessel.</p><p><br></p><h4>Elevator Platforms</h4><p>Each ship is equipped with an elevator platform that can be lowered and raised with a lever to make loading and unloading cargo easier. When not in use, this platform stays in the lowest cargo hold of each ship. See the descriptions of the cargo holds for more information.</p><p><br></p><h4>Lighting</h4><p>Areas belowdecks are brightly lit by hanging lanterns.</p><p><br></p><h4>Rigging</h4><p>Rigging can be climbed without an ability check.</p><hr><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Areas of the Ships</span><br></p><p>The <i>Eyecatcher</i>, the <i>Heartbreaker</i>, and the <i>Hellraiser</i> have the same general configuration and occupants, corresponding to the map above.

If the characters board the ship and ask to speak with the captain, the mate asks their business before even thinking about disturbing him.</p><p><b><i>Jolly Boats.</i></b> Four rowboats are stacked on top of each other on this deck. Ropes and pulleys are used to hoist these boats in and out of the water.</p><p><br></p><h4>J2. Storage</h4><p>The smell of tar permeates this cluttered cabin, which contains the following features:</p><ul><li>Barrels of tar are secured with nets to the starboard wall below mounted tools.</li><li>Against the port wall, tight rolls of white canvas are stacked on top of each other and secured with rope.</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>J3. Mates' Cabin</h4><p>This cabin has the following features:</p><ul><li>Twin hammocks hang perpendicular to one another. Two off-duty mates (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTk1ODRlNTdjN2Qw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow elite warriors</a></b>) relax in the hammocks.</li><li>Three walnut chests sit under the hammocks. The chests are unlocked.</li></ul><p><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> Each chest holds two sets of common clothes, a waterskin filled with wine, and a pouch containing 3d6 gp and 4d10 sp.</p><p><br></p><h4>J4. Crew Cabins</h4><p>Each of these cabins holds four hammocks. One off-duty sailor (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmIxMzgwZTgyODdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow</a></b>) rests in each cabin.</p><p><br></p><h4>J5. Galley</h4><p>Heat and savory scents burst from this cramped cabin, which contains the following features:</p><ul><li>A busy cook (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b>) works a frying pan with one hand and stirs a pot with the other over a small stove.</li><li>Dirty dishes are stacked in a washbasin.</li><li>A table holds foods in various states of preparation.</li></ul><p>The cook is too busy to speak with characters, and is quick to holler in alarm if attacked, drawing the attention of the crew.</p><p><br></p><h4>J6. Pantry</h4><p>Secured to the walls are racks of cooking ingredients, including jars of spices, sacks of flour, and casks of lard.</p><p><br></p><h4>J7. Dining Cabin</h4><p>The crew dines here throughout the day. At any given time, the cabin contains the following:</p><ul><li>Six sailors (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmIxMzgwZTgyODdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow</a></b>) are enjoying a meal.</li><li>Aboard the <i>Heartbreaker</i> or the <i>Hellraiser</i>, the sailors are joined by 1d4 carnies (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></b>).</li><li>Furnishings include a table, ten stools, and two oak cabinets containing dishes, tankards, and utensils.</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>J8. Forecastle</h4><p>The forecastle is within sight of the sailors on the main deck (area J1), the aft castle lower deck (area J9), and the aft castle upper deck (area J11).</p><p><b><i>Figurehead.</i></b> A gilded wooden figurehead of a female elf with flowing hair sticks out from the ship's prow, reaching forth with both hands. Since the figurehead is unpainted, there's no way to tell that it depicts a drow, but a character who inspects the figurehead closely and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a tiny embossed spider on its forehead.</p><p>A <i>detect magic</i> spell or similar magic reveals an aura of illusion magic around the figurehead—the effect that makes every drow aboard the ship appear as a human. A drow's gender, height, and weight are unchanged; the illusion affects only appearance, not voice or mannerisms. Casting <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODY4Zjg3NjhmMDkw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>dispel magic</a></i> on a disguised drow causes the illusion around it to wink out only for a moment. An <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZmNjMmUyNTdhMjY3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>antimagic field</a></i> suppresses the figurehead's magic within the field's area. Destroying the figurehead ends the effect throughout the ship. A figurehead has AC 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p><p><br></p><h4>J9. Aft Castle Lower Deck</h4><p>This deck has the following features:</p><ul><li>Two sailors (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmIxMzgwZTgyODdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow</a></b>) are here at all times.</li><li>Stairs to port and starboard climb to the aft castle upper deck (area J11) and the captain's wheel.</li></ul><p><b><i>Anchor.</i></b> The ship's anchor is accessed from this deck. It can be raised or lowered by one creature in 10 rounds (1 minute), by two creatures in 5 rounds, by three creatures in 3 rounds, or by four creatures in 1 round.</p><p><br></p><h4>J10. Captain's Cabin</h4><p>Regardless of which ship the characters are on, this opulent cabin contains the following features:</p><ul><li>Stylish purple drapes cover the large windows that look out over the harbor.</li><li>To one side of a central pillar rests a comfortable bed, its oak headboard carved to resemble a kraken. An oak dining table surrounded by six high-backed chairs rests on the opposite side of the central pillar.</li><li>Other furnishings include a glass-doored cabinet containing shelves of books, a wooden trunk sealed with a padlock, and a small writing desk.</li></ul><p><b><i>Captain.</i></b> Each ship's captain (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWM4YzExNGZiMjUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow mage</a></b>) can usually be found here, with a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjZWI0MzEyNTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>nimblewright</a></b>&nbsp;acting as an attendant and bodyguard.</p><p>A captain is happy to meet with characters who ask to speak with him, mostly to gauge whether they pose a threat. If the characters are polite, the captain invites them to join him for a meal. If the characters grow tiresome or threatening, he commands them to leave the ship at once, sounding an alarm if they refuse.</p><p>Fastened to each captain's belt is a ring holding a number of keys. One key unlocks the trunk in this cabin; other keys unlock any locked doors on the captain's ship.</p><p><b><i>Book Cabinet.</i></b> Each captain keeps a modest collection of mundane books. Each hides his spellbook in a secret space under the bottom shelf, which can be found with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check. The spellbook contains the following spells: <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YjMwYmRkY2I4NGQy ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>cone of cold</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NjRlYjhlMGJkYWNi ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>control water</a></i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/\">,</a> <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=OTBlNDFkZThmMzE4 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>counterspell</a></i>,<a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/\"> </a><i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NGViNGI3MTJmYzQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect magic</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Y2U4YmRiOWRmMDQy ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>fireball</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MmUwZDY3OWM5ZDFm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>fly</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YjRmMjczMGQ0YTVl ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>greater invisibility</a></i>,<a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/\"> </a><i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/\"></a><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NDAyNDUyOWJiZjFj ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>ice storm</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZDBjMTViNWU5NTRm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>mage armor</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NDIyZWExNTliMGE3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>magic missile</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZGE4MGM5NTBjMGFh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>misty step</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells%3ARary's%20Telepathic%20Bond\">Rary's telepathic bond</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Mjk0OGViOTEyZjIx ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>sending</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=M2VhMTBlMDlmNzc3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>shield</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=N2Y0ZTAzMGY3YmM5 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>suggestion</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=N2MwMjhkY2U3M2Q2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>thunderwave</a></i>, <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZDQxYmFjZmQyNzZh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>water breathing</a></i>, and <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YzFlNzgwODU4Yjlh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>web</a></i>.<br></p><p><b><i>Locked Trunk.</i></b> A successful DC 20 Dexterity check by a character using thieves' tools opens the padlock, or it can be broken off with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. The trunk contains folded clothes, 250 gp in a sack, 1d6 pearls (worth 100 gp each) in a silk pouch, a <i>potion of water breathing</i>, and a bottle of excellent wine (worth 25 gp), bearing a label in the shape of an eye patch and the name “One-Eyed Jax” in Common.</p><p><br></p><h4>J11. Aft Castle Upper Deck</h4><p>This highest deck of the ship is within sight of the forecastle (area J8), the main deck (area J1), and the aft castle lower deck (area J9). It has the following features:</p><ul><li>The ship's wheel stands atop the deck.</li><li>Two sailors (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmIxMzgwZTgyODdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow</a></b>) are stationed here at all times.</li></ul><p><b><i>Wheel.</i></b> If the ship is sailing with a full crew, a character who has proficiency with water vehicles can stand at the wheel and steer the vessel.</p><p><br></p><h4>J12. Upper Cargo Hold</h4><p>This hold contains the following features:</p><ul><li>Large grilled doors in the ceiling open to allow goods to be moved to and from this hold using the cargo elevator. A 15-foot-by-10-foot section of floor opens to reveal the lower cargo hold (area J17 aboard the <i>Eyecatcher</i> or the <i>Hellraiser</i>; area J19 aboard the <i>Heartbreaker</i>).</li><li>Crates and barrels stacked to the ceiling are tied down to ensure that they don't move. These containers hold food and water for the crew and the carnies.</li></ul><p><b><i>Cargo Elevator.</i></b> To activate an elevator platform, a creature must stand on the platform and use an action to pull a lever up or down. The platform can't be raised higher than the main deck (area J1) or lowered deeper than a ship's lowest cargo hold.</p><p>The trapdoor in the floor opens when the cargo elevator is raised. If the platform is raised to area J1, the trapdoor remains open until the elevator platform returns to this area or area J17 (J19 on the <i>Heartbreaker</i>).</p><p><br></p><h4>J13. Head</h4><p>The reek of urine fills the cramped head. Privies—each little more than a bench seat with a hole open to the water below—are this room's only features.</p><p><br></p><h4>J14. Carnies' Cabins</h4><p>Eight narrow cabins are fitted with hammocks, each of which holds a resting carnival performer or worker (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b>). Carnies call for help when they are confronted by intruders and fight only in self-defense.</p><p><br></p><h4>J15. Brig</h4><p>A door made of crisscrossing iron bars and fitted with a sturdy lock seals off this cabin, whose only feature is a chamber pot. The captain carries the key to the door. The lock can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves' tools (made with disadvantage from inside the cell). A successful DC 23 Strength (Athletics) check forces the door open. The door has AC 19, a damage threshold of 10, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p><p><b><i>Jailed Sailor.</i></b> There's a 25 percent chance that a sailor (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmIxMzgwZTgyODdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow</a></b>) is being held in the brig after punching a crewmate during an argument.</p><p><br></p><h4>J16. Armory</h4><p>The drow store their weapons and armor here while the ship is at sea. If the characters are captured and stripped of their equipment, their nonmagical belongings are stowed here. The cabin has the following features:</p><ul><li>Empty weapon racks and armor hooks line the walls.</li><li>Stairs lead down into the ship's belly.</li></ul><p><b><i>Safe (Eyecatcher Only).</i></b> The armory aboard the Eyecatcher also features a 750-pound cast iron safe with a combination lock. Jarlaxle and his lieutenants (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTJiNGJlNTc2MjQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Fel'rekt Lafeen</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTBhNjQwNTY2MDFk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Krebbyg Masq'il'yr</a>, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjlkNzNjNWM5ZTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Soluun Xibrindas</a>) know the combination: 1–20–59. A character can pick the lock with a successful DC 25 Dexterity (Investigation) check using thieves' tools. Each attempt takes 1 minute. A knock spell or similar magic also opens the safe, which contains three pistols, twelve leather packets of smokepowder, three leather pouches containing twenty bullets each, and 250 gp in a sack.</p><p><b><i>Stairs.</i></b> The stairs lead to area J17 on the <i>Eyecatcher</i> or the <i>Hellraiser</i>, or to area J20 on the <i>Heartbreaker</i>.</p><p><br></p><h4>J17. Lower Cargo Hold</h4><p><i>Eyecatcher and Hellraiser only</i></p><p>The fantastical floats of the Sea Maidens Faire are broken down and kept in the lower cargo hold of the <i>Hellraiser</i>, while the <i>Eyecatcher</i> holds pieces of broken and experimental floats. (See area J19 for a description of the <i>Heartbreaker</i>'s lower cargo hold.)</p><p><b><i>Cargo Elevator.</i></b> If the cargo elevator platform is lowered to this area while creatures are in the 15-foot-by-10-foot space where the platform lands, each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and restrained until the platform is raised. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw moves to a space of its choice next to the elevator platform without provoking opportunity attacks.</p><p><b><i>Hellraiser's Hold.</i></b> The hold of the Hellraiser is mostly cleared out on days when parades are scheduled, except for empty storage trunks. On other days, it contains the following paraphernalia:</p><ul><li>Various trunks filled with musician, dancer, acrobat, and clown costumes</li><li>Casks holding confetti, glitter, and body paint</li><li>Bundles of wooden stilts (4 and 8 feet high)</li><li>Papier-mâché beholders mounted atop 10-foot poles</li><li>A float topped by a life-size mechanical unicorn ridden by a mechanical drow ranger waving two scimitars (when a lever under the float is pulled, the unicorn farts a 15-foot cone of confetti, which it can do twice before needing to be refilled)</li><li>A float topped with two mechanical goblins that repeatedly punch each other when wound up</li><li>A float bearing a mechanical armored knight battling a mechanical pit fiend (when wound up, the knight cleaves with its sword while the devil flaps its wings)</li><li>Deflated black, blue, green, red, and white dragon balloons (they float magically when filled with air, and their size is Huge while inflated)</li><li>An enormous tarrasque puppet for five puppeteers</li><li>Wagon covers decorated with tassels and painted with colorful patterns and creatures</li><li>Horse and ox harnesses, all brightly decorated</li></ul><p><b><i>Eyecatcher's Hold.</i></b> The aft section of the hold of the Eyecatcher is guarded by four <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZmQ3MjkyZGYxMTQ2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>giant spiders</a></b> painted in bright colors. These arachnids have been trained by Jarlaxle since they were hatchlings, and they can pass themselves off as inanimate float decorations by remaining perfectly still until they attack. They aren't hostile toward drow, whose true nature they sense despite the ship's illusion magic. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher realize that the spiders are a threat before the creatures attack.</p><p>All sorts of damaged and unfinished attractions are stored here, including the following:</p><ul><li>A number of broken clockwork monsters</li><li>Half-completed or broken wagon covers and puppets</li><li>A deflated balloon of an oversized flumph that has a small gash in it (a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YTk2ZjMyNjgxYWNj ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>mending</a></i> cantrip can repair the damage)</li><li>An undecorated float, topped with an unpainted mechanical gold dragon made of canvas stretched over a wooden frame</li></ul><p>Rigged with a glass canister of flammable gas, the mechanical gold dragon is designed to breathe fire when a lever is pulled. Pulling the lever cracks the canister and sets the dragon on fire. If the fire breaks out here and isn't extinguished promptly, it spreads to other parts of the hold after 1 minute. Crew members in other parts of the ship detect smoke 5 minutes later, by which time the hold is a raging inferno. Crew members will focus on saving the submarine (if it's still attached) before abandoning ship.</p><p><br></p><h4>J18. Craft Supplies</h4><p><i>Eyecatcher and Hellraiser only</i></p><p>Each of these cabins contains materials used to decorate floats:</p><ul><li>Glitter, feathers, fabric, paper, scissors, sewing needles, spools of colored thread, and flasks of glue are strewn over small tables.</li><li>Schematics for parade floats are tacked to the walls alongside various tools.</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>J19. Lower Cargo Hold</h4><p><i>Heartbreaker only</i></p><p>Beastly odors fill the hold of the <i>Heartbreaker</i>, becoming stronger as the characters get closer to the creature pens (area J20). The hold is mostly empty on parade days. On other days, it contains disassembled wagons (axles, wheels, and cages) that are used to pull exotic creatures through crowded streets. Tools needed to assemble and repair the wagons hang from hooks on the walls.</p><p><b><i>Cargo Elevator.</i></b> If the cargo elevator platform is lowered to this area while creatures are in the 15-foot-by-10-foot space where the platform lands, each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and restrained until the platform is raised. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw moves to a space of its choice next to the elevator platform without provoking opportunity attacks.</p><p><br></p><h4>J20. Creature Pens</h4><p><i>Heartbreaker only</i></p><p>This section of the hold reeks of animal musk and waste. When they're not being paraded through city streets in cage-wagons, the monstrous attractions of the Sea Maidens Faire growl, chortle, stamp, snort, and roar in closed stalls. Two handlers (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></b> with proficiency in Animal Handling) walk from stall to stall, carrying buckets of food and speaking softly to the creatures.</p><p>Each pen is effectively a cell equipped with a sliding door that can be double-latched from the outside. A wagon assembled in area J19 can be backed up to any pen. With the pen door open, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check then coaxes a caged creature into the back of a wagon. This check is made with advantage if food is given to the creature. If this check fails by 5 or more, the creature escapes, panics, and begins attacking indiscriminately as it tries to win its freedom. Any such ruckus alerts the animal handlers or other crew members if they are nearby.</p><p>The following creatures are kept in the twelve pens:</p><table class=\"userscript-table userscript-table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Two <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDQ2MWY0ODNlZWRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>apes</a></b></td><td>Four <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjM4OTA1MzJmMmM5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>giant fire beetles</a></b></td></tr><tr><td>One <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjNmZTk3M2JlY2Nl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>rhinoceros</a></b></td><td>One <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNlZGMxZDE0ZWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>hippogriff</a></b></td></tr><tr><td>One <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGU3ZjVmZTdlOWUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>tiger</a></b></td><td>One <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzM4MmY5YjBlYjc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>axe beak</a></b></td></tr><tr><td>One <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDk1OGNmNGM0OWUw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>allosaurus</a></b></td><td>Two <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODI1ZGU3NzEzYmVh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>death dogs</a></b></td></tr><tr><td>Two <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzA3MjY1YTNlNzIy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>panthers</a></b></td><td>One <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjJhOTIxYTExMGY3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>giant vulture</a></b></td></tr><tr><td>One <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTFkNDQ0MmQyOGFh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>owlbear</a></b></td><td>One <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzA4MDU3MDliOTlj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>polar bear</a></b></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The death dogs and the giant vulture are evil, and the giant vulture can understand Common (though it can't speak). They seize any chance to escape and revel in the suffering of other creatures.<br></p><p><br></p><h4>J21. Handlers' Cabin</h4><p><i>Heartbreaker only</i></p><p>This cabin contains hammocks for the two handlers who work in area J20. If the creatures have been taken on parade, the handlers are asleep in their hammocks.</p><p><br></p><h4>J22. Beast Supplies</h4><p><i>Heartbreaker only</i></p><p>Supplies and food for the creatures in area J20 are stored here:</p><ul><li>Haunches of meat hanging from the ceiling give this cabin a sickly sweet scent.</li><li>Shovels, ropes, chains, buckets, bales of hay, and several large crates are pushed against the walls.</li></ul><p>The crates hold a variety of lichens, mosses, and fungi that are fed to the herbivorous creatures. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies the vegetation as native to the Underdark, and the haunches of animal meat as deep rothé—an ox-like creature raised for its meat by drow in the Underdark.</p><p><br></p><h4>J23. Gunslingers' Hold</h4><p><i>Heartbreaker and Hellraiser only</i></p><p>No one is allowed down here without the captain's permission, and the guards have orders to kill trespassers on sight. This area contains the following features:</p><ul><li>Two <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkM2E1NjA1ZmRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow gunslingers</a></b> stand guard outside area J27.</li><li>The hold is filled with barrels containing ale and fresh water. The barrels are held down by cargo nets hooked to the floor.</li></ul><p><b><i>Drow Gunslingers.</i></b> The drow take cover behind the walls that divide this area as they shoot. They fight to the death to keep intruders from reaching area J27.</p><p><br></p><h4>J24. Cleaning Supplies</h4><p>These closets hold mops, brushes, buckets, and soap used for scrubbing the decks.</p><p><br></p><h4>J25. Gunslingers' Cabins</h4><p><i>Heartbreaker and Hellraiser only</i></p><p>These two cabins are the quarters of the drow gunslingers in area J23. Each contains the following features:</p><ul><li>A hammock hangs on the wall opposite the door.</li><li>A wooden mannequin and a walnut chest rest against the wall by the door.</li></ul><p>The mannequins double as armor racks, though no armor currently adorns them.</p><p><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> Each chest holds two sets of common clothes, a water skin filled with wine, and a pouch containing 3d6 gp and 4d10 sp.</p><p><br></p><h4>J26. Lockers</h4><p><i>Heartbreaker and Hellraiser only</i></p><p>Lining this hall are eight closets used as storage lockers by the workers and performers of the Sea Maidens Faire. They contain traveling clothes and outerwear hanging on hooks, as well as boots and shoes.</p><p><br></p><h4>J27. Smokepowder Storage</h4><p><i>Heartbreaker and Hellraiser only</i></p><p>The locked door to this forward cabin has a wooden sign nailed to the outside that reads, in Common and Elvish, “RESTRICTED AREA. DO NOT ENTER.” The room contains the following features:</p><ul><li>Twenty wooden kegs are secured to the walls with ropes. Each keg has a paper label, written on which are the words “SMOKEPOWDER! EXPLOSIVE!” in Common and Elvish.</li><li>A shelf above the kegs is lined with wooden boxes.</li></ul><p><b><i>Boxes.</i></b> Ten wooden boxes on the shelf each contain one hundred pistol bullets.</p><p><b><i>Kegs.</i></b> Each keg holds five pounds of <i>smokepowder</i>. When one keg explodes, all other kegs within the area of effect explode as well. If half the kegs explode at once, the blast blows a hole in the forward hull large enough to sink the ship. If all twenty kegs explode at once, the blast blows half the ship to smithereens, shatters windows throughout the Dock Ward, and can be heard as far away as the Field Ward.</p><p><br></p><h4>J28. Walk-in Closets</h4><p><i>Eyecatcher only</i></p><p>The doors to these closets are locked from the outside.</p><p><b><i>Port Closet.</i></b> This closet abuts Jarlaxle's cabin (area J30) and contains tailored outfits and cloaks for every season and occasion, as well as towels. Against the back wall stands a wooden mannequin wearing an eye patch. A secret door along one wall can be detected with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p><p><b><i>Starboard Closet.</i></b> This closet abuts the guest cabin (area J29) and contains a half-dozen gowns and two soft fur cloaks on hangers, ladies' hats on hooks, and fancy towels and shoes on shelves. A secret door along one wall can be detected with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p><p><br></p><h4>J29. Guest Cabin</h4><p><i>Eyecatcher only</i></p><p>This richly appointed cabin is set aside for special guests. It contains a large bed, a wooden chest, a freestanding mirror, and a dresser with a lyre atop it. Empty wine bottles roll back and forth across the floor as the ship moves. The bed holds three giggling figures:</p><ul><li><b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkMzA3NzY2ZmMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jarlaxle Baenre</a></b>, in the guise of Zardoz Zord (absent if he's marshalling the Day of Wonders parade; see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDhkZDBlYTY5MDU4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events</a>”).</li><li>Margo Verida, a female Amnian human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE5M2E2NDQ4M2I3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bard</a></b></li><li>Khafeyta Murzan, a female Mulhorandi human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWVkYjViNmM0MWEz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swashbuckler</a></b></li></ul><p>Margo and Khafeyta both joined the Sea Maidens Faire within the past year—Margo as a lyrist, Khafeyta as an acrobat. Jarlaxle has taken a romantic interest in both women, who are also in love with each other.</p><p>Margo and Khafeyta are polite but terse. Both are neutral good. If attacked, they grab their weapons and other belongings and flee through a secret door (see below).</p><p>If separated from Jarlaxle and compelled to divulge information about their host, Margo and Khafeyta reveal some or all of the following facts:</p><ul><li>Zardoz Zord is a drow named Jarlaxle in disguise.</li><li>Each ship in the Sea Maidens Faire is crewed by drow. The ships' figureheads cast illusions on the drow, making them appear human.</li><li>Jarlaxle wants the Lords' Alliance to recognize his city, Luskan, as a new member, and he wants to push Neverwinter out of the alliance.</li><li>A year ago, the Sea Maidens Faire visited the island nation of Lantan, where Jarlaxle obtained a Lantanese submarine and several clockwork servants.</li></ul><p><b><i>Secret Door.</i></b> A secret door leading to a walk-in closet (area J28) can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p><p><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> Margo's lyre is worth 30 gp. An unlocked chest at the foot of the bed holds four sets of costume clothing and a jewelry box containing six gold bracelets (worth 25 gp each), two diamond rings (worth 250 gp each), and a pearl necklace (worth 500 gp).</p><p><br></p><h4>J30. Zardoz Zord's Cabin</h4><p><i>Eyecatcher only</i></p><p>The doors to this cabin are locked. If anyone other than Jarlaxle turns the handle of either door, a magic mouth spell activates and shouts, “By Lolth's teeth, have you no manners?” The sound is loud enough to be heard by Jarlaxle (if he is in area J29), and he comes to investigate. The room contains the following features:</p><ul><li>The sweet smell of lavender permeates the cabin. (The scent is created by magic and can be dispelled.)</li><li>A <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjZWI0MzEyNTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>nimblewright</a></b>&nbsp;stands in a small alcove next to a chess table. An empty wine bottle on the table is labeled “One-Eyed Jax” in Common.</li><li>Behind a purple curtain, a bed is covered by a soft blue blanket and matching pillows. Next to the bed is a wooden chest with clawed feet.</li></ul><p><b><i>Nimblewright.</i></b> The nimblewright serves Jarlaxle as a servant, and it obeys its master's commands without question. Absent orders, it attacks anyone who discovers the trapdoor in the floor (see below).</p><p><b><i>Secret Doors.</i></b> Any character who searches the cabin and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a secret door leading to a walk-in closet (area J28) and a secret trapdoor in the floor.</p><p>The trapdoor has an arcane lock spell cast on it, but rapping on it three times suppresses the spell for 1 minute. Alternatively, the trapdoor can be forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p>Below the trapdoor, a metal ladder descends to the bottom of a 10-foot-long, 3-foot-diameter steel tube with a circular metal hatch at the bottom. The hatch is opened by turning its valve wheel, which grants access to area U1 on the Scarlet Marpenoth. This area is magically pressurized to keep water from entering the ship if the hatch is opened while the submarine isn't docked.</p><p><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> The chess set features jade pieces shaped like drow and is worth 2,500 gp.</p><p><br></p><h4>J31. Training Area</h4><p><i>Eyecatcher only</i></p><p>Jarlaxle trains here regularly. The space contains the following features:</p><ul><li>Ropes are strung throughout the area like webs.</li><li>Four rapiers hang from a wooden rack attached to the mast.</li><li>Five beat-up mannequins made of wood, straw, and canvas stand about the room. Each holds a wooden sword and a wooden shield.</li><li>A dartboard mounted on one wall has a shiny dagger sticking into it.</li></ul><p><b><i>Attack Mannequins.</i></b> As a bonus action, Jarlaxle can command the five magic mannequins to animate and attack a single target of his choice. Each mannequin has the statistics of <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDViZGUwN2ZjZTI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>animated armor</a></b>. Mannequins that take damage become inanimate until Jarlaxle uses another bonus action to reanimate them. A mannequin targeted by a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YTk2ZjMyNjgxYWNj ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i><i>mending</i> </a>cantrip regains 1 hit point.</p><p><b><i>Dagger.</i></b> The dagger in the dartboard is a +1 dagger.</p><p><b><i>Ropes.</i></b> The ropes make all parts of this area difficult terrain. As part of its movement, a creature can maneuver around the ropes with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, negating the ropes' effect for that creature until the end of its turn.</p><p><br></p><h4>J32. Jarlaxle's Sauna</h4><p><i>Eyecatcher only</i></p><p>The door to this room is closed with an exterior hook latch. When the door is opened, clouds of steam billow out from the area beyond. This steam is created magically and can be dispelled with a successful casting of <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODY4Zjg3NjhmMDkw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>dispel magic</a></i> (DC 14). The room holds only a wooden bench.</p><p><b><i>Steam.</i></b> The steam has no adverse effect for the first hour. For each additional hour spent in this room, a creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures immune to fire damage automatically succeed on this save.</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/013_-_Dragon_Heist_3A_Autumn_Adventure/001_-_Chapter_7_3A_Maestro_27s_Fall/002_-_Areas_of_the_Ships/avatar.png"}

A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.</p><p>Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.</p><p>Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the DM's control. Any activated property of the item is under the item's control, not its wielder's.

If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it make one or more of the following demands:<br></p><ul><li>The item insists on being carried or worn at all times</li><li>The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.</li><li>The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's goals to the exclusion of all other goals.</li><li>The item demands to be given to someone else.<br></li></ul><p>If its wielder refuses to comply with the item's wishes the item can do any or all of the following:<br></p><ul><li>Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.</li><li>Suppress one or more of its activated properties.</li><li>Attempt to take control of its wielder.<br></li></ul><p>If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier.

{"_id":"NWU5NTBlNmEyMWU3","name":"The City's Splendors","permission":{"default":0},"folder":"MmEyMTg5YjQwYjFk","flags":{"R20Converter":{"handout-order":5,"handout-archived":false}},"sort":50000,"entryTime":0,"content":"<h2>The City's Splendors<br></h2><p>A description of each of the features that cause Waterdeep to be called the City of Splendors would require a library's worth of paper. This chapbook can't hope to encompass them all, no matter its author's expertise with a quill. However, I shall endeavor to enlighten you about several sights that have not been mentioned earlier, and to expand upon some previously covered.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Amenities</span></h3><p>You'll find no city on the Sword Coast or in all the North half as civilized as Waterdeep. It's not just the law of the land that makes this so, but also the comforts that life here provides.</p><p>In most other towns and cities, you'll start with an early-morning stumble on the stairs as you carry your night soil down to deposit it outside. But in Waterdeep, many buildings are connected directly to the sewers. Public facilities for those out and about can be found all around the Market and the Field of Triumph, and near the largest city squares. In places without ready access to sewers or public outhouses, members of the Dungsweepers' Guild make multiple rounds each day, collecting urine and excrement separately—for use in industry and agriculture, respectively. Take comfort that in Waterdeep, you'll always find a pot to piss in.</p><p>Also notice how clean the streets are kept. This upkeep is due in large part to the hard work of the Dungsweepers' Guild. Dungsweepers can be seen working their brooms and carts at every hour of the day—and for a few hours after dark—all over the city, removing not just animal dung but other refuse. This service is free to all, paid for by taxes rendered to the city—although an egregious amount of trash left for pickup does result in a separate bill from the guild.</p><p>Another amenity soon appreciated by visitors is Waterdeep's water system. With public fountains and wells all about the city, clean water is plentiful. Many buildings have pumps of their own to draw water from the local supply, and some even possess taps that pour out water with the twist of a knob. This convenience is made possible by the inventiveness of the Gondar, the industry of the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild, and the magic that Waterdeep inherited from the Illefarni elves.</p><p>Waterdeep is also a city of light. <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZWIyNjY0MDNmM2Nm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>Continual flame</a></i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZWIyNjY0MDNmM2Nm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> </a>spells illuminate many signs and streetlamps in the wealthier parts of the city. Elsewhere, the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters keeps the streets lit (excepting the Field Ward and the most dangerous areas of the Dock Ward). Not only that, but hundreds of <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MjE2ZDUwZDdkNzI0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>driftglobes</a></i> bob about the City of the Dead at night, departing to float over the rest of the city each morning. Such is not typical behavior for <i>driftglobes</i>, I assure you!</p><p>Lastly, no city in the world is as literate as Waterdeep. Oghma's priests from the Font of Knowledge offer free instruction in reading to all who desire it, and the city has over thirty publishers of broadsheets in addition to chapbook printers and book publishers. Large paper advertisements are plastered onto alley walls, and smaller ones are passed out by those hired by businesses to trumpet their services. Printed menus can be found posted in the windows of most eateries and are handed out to those who dine within. Admittedly, you'll see less reading material in the Dock Ward and the Field Ward, but this fact is notable only because of its preponderance elsewhere.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">The Griffon Cavalry</span></h3><p>Waterdeep doesn't have the fabled flying ships of Halruaa, but it does deploy an aerial defense force. Brave warriors of the City Guard light out from the Peaktop Aerie atop Mount Waterdeep, riding fearsome griffons that have been bred and trained for that purpose. Each of the riders is equipped with a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDVkNWQzNzM3M2Ji ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>ring of feather falling</a></i>—not merely to prevent death from mishap, but to allow them to perform stunning feats of aerial acrobatics.</p><p>In both martial displays and in real battles against flying threats such as manticores, harpies, and outlaw wizards, the griffon riders actually leap off their mounts into the open air! For a breath-stealing moment, they fall like stones, closing in on their targets at incredible speed. Their opponents rarely see the death blow, distracted as they are by other mounted griffon riders. When they are past the danger, the free-falling riders then suddenly halt in the air, drifting like feathers until their griffon companions swoop in and they regain their saddles. Working in concert with one another in this fashion, members of the Griffon Cavalry can rapidly eliminate any threat to the city—and even catch the body of the offender before it hits the rooftops below.<br></p><p>Riders of the Griffon Cavalry are trained to stay above the rooftops, not because they fear crashing into towers and weather vanes, but because the smell of so much horseflesh in the streets below can sometimes drive their griffons into a frenzy.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">The Walking Statues</span></h3><p>Over a century ago, just one of these eight behemoth statues stood visible at the northern foot of Mount Waterdeep, on a bluff called Gull Leap. Ninety feet tall, it resembled a bald human staring out to sea. Later events (discussed below) caused it to be transformed into the statue known today as the Sahuagin Humbled.</p><p>When the Spellplague gripped Waterdeep in 1385 DR, six more walking statues suddenly appeared in the city, wandering to wreak havoc even as the Sahuagin Humbled remained motionless. The authorities and citizens of Waterdeep succeeded in stopping three of these new statues, breaking the Swordmaiden and the Hawk Man, and sinking the God Catcher into the street up to its waist. Then all the statues mysteriously stopped their rampage just as quickly as they had begun it. Tsarra Chaadren, the Blackstaff at the time, couldn't command them to return to their former hiding places on the Ethereal Plane. Consequently, the city repaired itself and built up around them. Much later, in 1479 DR, the eighth statue—the Griffon—emerged from the Ethereal Plane to defend Ahghairon's Tower against intrusion. It roosted there for a time before flying to its current position near Peaktop Aerie on Mount Waterdeep. Once more, this activity seemed to be outside the Blackstaff's control. Thankfully, all the walking statues have been dormant for well over a decade now, serving only as beautiful, cyclopean reminders of Waterdeep's might.</p><h4>The God Catcher</h4><p>This is perhaps the most famous walking statue in the city, thanks to its dramatic pose, its nearness to the Market, and the self-evident magic of its existence. The statue is of a well-muscled but impassive male human with its left leg sunk to the hip in the street, the result of a spell cast by the Blackstaff at the time of its rampage. Its left hand and right foot press against the ground as if it is trying to pull itself out. Its right arm is raised skyward, and above its open palm floats a sphere of stone. Its gaze looks up toward the sphere, and the pattern of bird droppings around its eyes gives it the appearance of weeping.</p><p>All about the statue, climbing up its chest and on its knee and shoulders, is a tenement that carries the name “the God Catcher.” The tenement's landlord is Aundra Blackcloak, an unsociable sorcerer who is rarely seen in the city except when she alights from the door carved in the floating sphere, which serves as her home. On the rare occasions when she wants to meet with city folk (typically to purchase odd substances for magical purposes), she appears unannounced on balconies or rooftops after dark. Her dealings are polite, though, and she pays fair coin. She never confides in anyone or talks about her own doings—and if anyone but she has ever seen the inside of her spherical home, they've said nothing publicly about it.</p><h4>The Griffon</h4><p>The walking statue called the Griffon is shaped like the beast for which it is named. Though it stands on all four legs, its back is fully twenty feet off the ground, making it a mount fit for a storm giant. Although it has shown itself to be capable of flight, with the granite feathers of its wings spreading like a bird's, the Griffon now merely stands in a regal pose near Peaktop Aerie atop Mount Waterdeep, looking to the southeast over the Dock Ward. Newcomers sometimes assume it to be a monument to Waterdeep's Griffon Cavalry, but Waterdavians know better.</p><h4>The Sahuagin Humbled</h4><p>For years, the only visible walking statue of Waterdeep was known simply as “the walking statue.” It stood at the foot of Mount Waterdeep near the head of Julthoon Street. Then, after its critical role in defending the city against an invasion of sahuagin in 1370 DR, Khelben Blackstaff reshaped the statue into a sahuagin. It now bows low toward the House of Heroes on bended knee—a gesture of obeisance to the city, and an acknowledgment of the sacrifice of all who fought for the city in that war.</p><h4>The Great Drunkard</h4><p>This walking statue stopped its rampage as it approached the Market, then fell backward and sat upon a building. When it settled, its arms fell limp at its sides and its head tilted forward onto its chest, giving the impression that it had fallen asleep. The statue's huge stone battleaxe still stands nearby, its haft angled upright and its blade half buried in the cobbles. The rubble of the crushed building was long ago rebuilt into a broad stone stair (with railings and a ramp that drunkards are often rolled down) that ascends from the cobbles to the statue's lap. That lap now holds a two-story tavern also built from the rubble, called Gralkyn's Tankard. The unconscious pose of the statue and the tavern in its lap made the name of the Great Drunkard a natural fit.</p><h4>The Lady Dreaming</h4><p>This fair lady caused much chaos when she was active. The statue has the appearance of a female elf, whose hair and clothing appeared to flow naturally as it walked through the city during the Spellplague. When the walking statues stopped, this one toppled onto its side, taking on the appearance of a titanic sculpture of a noble lady asleep in her garden.</p><h4>The Honorable Knight</h4><p>The Honorable Knight is a statue of a male warrior in plate armor with a shield and longsword. When the walking statues stopped, it bowed to those opposing it, straightened, sheathed its sword, and doffed its shield, setting it point down on the ground and upright by its side. It then ceased motion in this position, facing southwest toward the harbor, and looking for all the world like a castle guard standing at ease. The pose it assumed led to its naming, and it is viewed with respect by the citizens of the southerly wards.</p><h4>The Hawk Man</h4><p>This statue looks like a winged, hawk-headed being, and thus locals call it the Hawk Man. I can reveal that in fact it bears much resemblance to an aarakocra, one of the bird-people said to live in the Star Mounts in the High Forest. The statue's wings are folded tightly against its back and have never unfurled, leaving its flight capability uncertain. It was brought low during its rampage across the city, and now it tilts decidedly toward the northeast due to a missing right foot—long ago broken up for building rubble, along with its right arm. Its left arm is extended out toward the north, palm forward as if in a gesture to say, “Stop.”</p><p>The body has been hollowed out and turned into a tower shared by several wealthy tenants, which is officially known as Sparaunt Tower after its owner. The statue's left hand extends over a courtyard to the north, wherein lies the entrance of a tunnel carved through the arm. Visitors and residents can ring a bell in the courtyard, whereupon a door guard acknowledges the ringer and lowers a rope ladder for tenants and expected guests (or a rope chair that is drawn up for guests who are infirm or laden with heavy items).</p><h4>The Swordmaiden</h4><p>This statue appears virtually identical to the Honorable Knight, except for its female form and open-faced helm. It was felled during the Spellplague after causing much chaos and slaughter. The residents of Waterdeep's North Ward funneled much of their frustrated and dismayed reaction to its rampage into dismantling the statue, parts of which can now be found all over the North Ward, either incorporated into buildings or as bits of freestanding sculpture.</p><p>The head of the Swordmaiden sits in a stand of tall trees in the center of the block of the North Ward bounded by Hassantyr's Street, Tarsar's Street, Whaelgond Way, and Ussilbran Street. The center of its jaw and mouth have been replaced by a door, which leads into the shop known as Thort's Findings. Undevvur Thort is a wizened ex-adventurer who leans on a cane (which some locals insist is more than just a cane). He lives in the small shop, whose many levels, staircases, and landings fill the hollowed-out interior of the head, and which is crammed with oddments sold to Thort by adventurers and other travelers. These items bear little placards in Thort's beautiful, flowing handwriting that identify them (or at least provide speculation as to their origin and purpose). Nobles and wealthy merchants who desire props for themed revels often rent some of Thort's wares as decoration—and many sages, alchemists, and wizards visit him regularly in search of potentially useful items.</p><p><b>Infamous Alleys<br></b>Waterdeep has as many alleys as Baldur's Gate has cats, and each has a name and a story. Here are a few that you might wish to see—or should know to avoid.</p><p><b><i>Ruid's Stroll.</i></b> This short avenue from Caravan Court to the Trollwall in the Southern Ward is haunted by the hooded ghost of the mage Ruid, whose touch causes deathly chills to those he meets on foggy nights. All attempts to banish or turn the spirit have failed. Those who brave its unearthly approach and allow Ruid to pass through them learn a secret truth about someone or something in their life—if they survive.</p><p><b><i>Brindul Alley.</i></b> This is the lair of the Hand that Sings, a magical phantasm of a hand with a mouth in its palm. The hand is said to snatch valuables it fancies—especially magical ones—when it encounters them, and to occasionally attack folk in the darkness, strangling them or tripping them into fatal falls. Most often, though, it takes no notice of those who don't bother or follow it, eerily singing fragments of old Sword Coast ballads and love songs as it drifts through the night.</p><p><b><i>Manycats Alley.</i></b> This passage crosses two city blocks and winds through the interior of a third, running between and (for the most part) parallel to Julthoon Street and Traders' Way in the North Ward. It is, unsurprisingly, home to many cats that feed on scraps from the surrounding butchers' shops, but it is also known for the many carved stone heads of people and animals that adorn the alley's buildings. Individuals who have walked the alley alone report that some of the heads whispered cryptic messages to them.</p><p><b><i>Gondwatch Lane.</i></b> Found at the southern entrance to the House of Inspired Hands in the Sea Ward, this alley serves as the testing ground for inventions considered too dangerous to operate inside the temple. The locals are generally unconcerned about the risks, though, and stand watching while food vendors circulate among them.</p><p><b><i>Pharra's Alley.</i></b> This alley in the Sea Ward is named after the first leader of the House of Wonder, but is more infamous for its Circle of Skulls. This infrequent and unpredictable haunting takes the form of seven floating skulls, which hover in a circle and argue with one another in whispered tones about events in the city. If they are interrupted, their reaction reportedly varies from being helpful to engaging in murderous spell-slinging.</p><p><b><i>Three Daggers Alley.</i></b> This alley in the Dock Ward suffers from a magical curse that causes three daggers to appear out of thin air and attack passersby. The daggers swoop and fly about, making multiple attempts at murder before vanishing again. This magical effect, the result of a spell cast by a long-dead wizard, has resisted all attempts to dispel it. Some locals boast of how many times they've crossed the alley and lived to tell of it, but the appearance of the daggers is entirely a matter of chance, and unpredictable. So take my advice and don't test Tymora's favor.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">City Celebrations</span></h3><p>At many times of year, hardly a tenday can pass in Waterdeep without the staging of some rite, race, or rousing ceremony of civic pride. Here I briefly summarize the most widely celebrated events on the calendar, from the first of Hammer to the last of Nightal.</p><h4>Hammer 1: Wintershield</h4><p>Marking the start of the new year, this observance is a widely recognized day off work, when folk sip warmed ciders and broths (often laced with herbs for health and to bring on visions) and stay inside. They tell tales of what interested them or was important in the year just done, and discuss what they intend to do or should deal with—or things that everyone “should keep a hawk's clear eye on”—in the year ahead.</p><p>Such talk inevitably leads to discussions of politics, wars, and the intentions of rulers. Maps are usually consulted, and it's widely considered lucky to possess and examine a map on Wintershield. Map sales are brisk in the tenday preceding this holiday.</p><h4>Alturiak 14: The Grand Revel</h4><p>Led by the clergy of Sune, Sharess, and Lliira, the Grand Revel is a day of dancing, music, and the consumption of sweet treats of all kinds, from chocolate to red firemint candies. Although some of the dancing is wanton and performed for show, large-scale ring dances in the street for all ages are also popular. All the dancing ends at dusk, after which bards and minstrels perform at “love feasts” for families. Couples—or those desiring to become couples—slip away together to kiss, exchange promises, and trade small tokens of affection (often rings blessed by clergy with prayers of faithfulness). Even if you have no paramour, indulge a little in the dance and food of this fine tradition. The night might be cold, but your heart will be warmed.</p><h4>Ches 1: Rhyestertide</h4><p>This holiday is named in honor of Lathander's first prophet, Rhyester, a young blind boy who was cured of that blindness by the dawn's light on this day more than seven centuries ago. That holy event occurred in the vicinity of Silverymoon, but Lathander has long had a much larger temple in Waterdeep, and a following to match. Each of the faithful dons bright garb of sunrise hues and keeps one eye covered until the next dawn in honor of Rhyester. If you want to feel like a local, catch the eye of any celebrant you see and wink. Fine friendships have grown from far less.</p><h4>Ches 19: Fey Day</h4><p>The veil between this world and the faerie realm of the Feywild is thought to be weak on this day. Though this phenomenon provokes caution in rural areas (with folk avoiding woodlands, putting offerings of food on doorsteps, and the like), it is an occasion of much drinking, singing, and dancing in Waterdeep. The wealthy host elaborate masked balls, while poorer folk don costumes of their own make and travel door to door, gaining brief entry into the celebrations in exchange for performing a song or a short play. All adopt the guises of fey beings and the supposed rulers of the Feywild, such as Queen Titania, Oberon, and Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools. Those inclined to remain sullen in the face of such frivolity had best stay home, for celebrants do their utmost to evoke a smile from those they meet.</p><h4>Ches 21–30: Fleetswake</h4><p>This festival celebrates the sea, maritime trade, and the gods of the sea, navigation, and weather. It spans the last tenday of Ches, and includes a series of boat races, the Shipwrights' Ball at the Shipwrights' House, and guild-sponsored galas at the Copper Cup festhall. According to custom, the winners of the various competitions don't keep their trophies and earnings, but deliver them to the priests of Umberlee at the Queenspire, her temple on the beach by the east entrance to the Great Harbor, at the conclusion of the festival.</p><p>The last two days of Fleetswake are the occasion of the Fair Seas Festival. During this time, there is much feasting on seafood, the harbor is strewn with flower petals, and City Guards go from tavern to tavern collecting offerings for Umberlee. Collection boxes also appear at large festival gatherings. Upon sunset of the final day, the collected coin is placed in chests and dumped into the deepest part of the harbor.</p><p>This festival has existed in a number of forms since the first trade-meets occurred here more than two millennia ago, and an uncountable amount of wealth remains sunken in what has long been known as Umberlee's Cache. The area is closely watched by merfolk guardians, whose standing orders are to kill anyone attempting to disturb it. Rumors abound that the chests have magical protections; one story tells of thieves who stole some of the collection years ago and tried to leave the city under false pretenses, only to see a squall spring up as soon as their ship left the harbor. A huge wave shaped like a hand swept the thieves overboard, but spared the ship and its crew.</p><h4>Tarsahk 1–10: Waukeentide</h4><p>This festival has long gathered a number of older holidays under one name, stretching those celebrations into a holiday season that lasts a tenday. Among the rituals in homage to the goddess of wealth and trade are these:</p><p><b>Caravance (Tarsahk 1).</b> This gift-giving holiday commemorates the traditional arrival of the first caravans of the season into the city. Many parents hide gifts for their offspring in their homes, telling the children that they were left by Old Carvas—a mythical peddler who arrived with the first caravan to reach Waterdeep, his wagon loaded down with toys for children to enjoy.</p><p><b>Goldenight (Tarsahk 5).</b> This festival celebrates coin and gold, with many businesses staying open all night, offering midnight sales and other promotions. Some celebrants and customers decorate themselves with gold dust and wear coins as jewelry.</p><p><b>Guildsmeet (Tarsahk 7).</b> On this holiday, guild members gather in their halls for the announcement of new policies and a celebration of business concluded for the year. These gatherings culminate in a gala festival and dance sponsored by several guilds, which lasts from dusk till dawn and overruns the Market, the Cynosure, the Field of Triumph, and all areas in between.</p><p><b>Leiruin (Tarsahk 10).</b> In times long past, Waukeen caught Leira, the goddess of illusions and deception, attempting to cheat her in a deal, and buried her under a mountain of molten gold as punishment. A commemoration of that event, Leiruin is the day for guild members to pay their annual dues and for guildmasters to meet with the Lords of Waterdeep and renew their charters for another year.</p><h4>Mirtul 6–9: The Plowing and Running</h4><p>Rural areas around the city observe this holiday in the traditional sense of shared activities of plowing fields and moving (or “running”) livestock. But within the city, the holiday is celebrated with a series of races. Foot, horse, and chariot races are run through courses in each ward, and the winners from each ward compete at the Field of Triumph. If you really want to see the wards come to life, this is the time. Pick your favorite, wear its colors, and cheer alongside its residents. Better yet, if you're of an adventuresome bent, register in your favored ward and compete! Who knows? Your name or visage might soon have a place in the House of Heroes.</p><h4>Kythorn 1: Trolltide</h4><p>On this day commemorating Waterdeep's victory in the Second Trollwar, children run through the city acting like trolls, banging on doors and growling, from highsun till dusk. Home and shop owners are expected to give the children candy, fruits, or small items. Those who give no treat can expect to become the target of a trick at sundown. This mischief typically takes the form of “troll scratchings” at doors and windows. Those with more malicious intent sing screechingly in the wee hours, and hurl raw eggs at windows, signs, and the heads of those who try to stop them. Have some candy on hand or some sweet rolls, and all will be calm where you live.</p><h4>Kythorn 14: Guildhall Day</h4><p>This day is a time of trade fairs. Most shops are closed, and street sales are suspended for all but walking food peddlers. Guildhall Day celebrates the fruits of everyone's labor with revelations of new products, innovations, fashions, and signage extolling the extent and quality of guild members' services and wares. These offerings usually take the form of glittering displays, but guilds sometimes also sponsor brief plays or other hired entertainments (jugglers, singers, magic shows put on by hedge wizards and professional raconteurs) at which prizes or free samples are distributed. Many guilds try to recruit during this time. Guildhall Day is an excellent time to browse the city's merchandise—and it doesn't matter if you can't afford what you see, because you can't buy it that day anyway.</p><h4>Kythorn 20: Dragondown</h4><p>This day in Kythorn is celebrated with bonfires and rituals to “tame” or “drive down” dragons. In Waterdeep, the celebrations take the form of parades that center around effigies built of wood and cloth and filled with straw. Each effigy is named and has a traditional depiction, for it represents one of a handful of dragons the city has faced in its history. After being paraded to a square near where the dragon was defeated or driven off, the enormous effigy is burned.</p><p>The height of the celebration comes when the effigy of Kistarianth the Red is burned on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep. A dracolich version of Kistarianth is then carried up the slopes and burned as well. These proceedings symbolize the defeat of Kistarianth first by the paladin Athar, and again decades later by his son, Piergeiron. Tradition dictates that the winners of the races run during the Plowing and Running take the role of the dragons' slayers, with the champion of the chariot race representing Athar and the champion of the horse race playing Piergeiron.</p><h4>Flamerule 1: Founders' Day</h4><p>This day commemorates the birth of the city. The Field of Triumph is the site of illusory displays that chronicle the history of Waterdeep, as well as martial exhibitions by the Guard and other worthies. Many festhalls sponsor Founders' Day costume contests, with prizes going to those who wear the best recreations of the garb of historical personages.</p><p>Once banned as frivolous and distracting, the practice of veiling Castle Waterdeep with an illusion has been reinstated. Several mages come together to produce the effect, which seemingly transforms the castle into the ancient log fortress of Nimoar. The illusion typically lasts from midday to sunset (unless someone has the audacity and magical might to dispel it) and is regarded as a stunning work of magical art.</p><h4>Flamerule 3–5: Sornyn</h4><p>Sornyn is a festival of both Waukeen and Lathander, and is used for planning business, making treaties and agreements, and receiving envoys from unknown lands and traditional foes. Much wine is drunk over this three-day occasion when, as the saying goes, “My enemy is like family to me.” If you are a newcomer to the city, this time is an excellent opportunity for you to engage with new partners in business or to gain financial support for some endeavor. My agreement to write <i>Volo's Guide to Waterdeep</i> was signed on a warm Sornyn evening many years ago, so who knows where your own initiative will take you?</p><h4>Flamerule 7: Lliira's Night</h4><p>Originally a celebration held only in Waterdeep, this holiday has since spread up and down the Sword Coast. It has received a recent boost in popularity from the custom started in Baldur's Gate of lighting celebratory <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MjYzOTlkZmZiN2Rh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>smokepowder</a> </i>fireworks—all purchased from Felogyr's Fireworks of that city, and utilized only by the City Guard, of course. This nightlong festival honors the Lady of Joy with dances and balls throughout the city. Pink beverages, ranging from healthy juices to deadly strong intoxicants, are imbibed. The boom and crackle of <i>smokepowder</i> explosions go off all night long, so you might as well stay up with the locals and enjoy the show.</p><h4>Eleasis 1: Ahghairon's Day</h4><p>Many small rituals are held throughout this day, dedicated to honoring the first Open Lord. The Lords of Waterdeep toast Ahghairon and the Watchful Order, and guildmasters toast the Lords in Ahghairon's name. Commoners leave violets (Ahghairon's favorite flower) around Ahghairon's Tower, on his statue in the City of the Dead, and atop the altars of the House of Wonder. Bards perform songs in honor of the wizard all over the city. The Open Lord visits taverns and inns throughout Waterdeep to wish the people well—giving short speeches, offering toasts to Ahghairon's memory, buying rounds of drinks, or paying for meals or accommodation. Needless to say, establishments of those sorts are generally full throughout the day.</p><h4>Eleint 21: Brightswords</h4><p>On this day, the City Guard, the City Navy, and the City Watch—all in glittering array—conduct parades, give demonstrations of martial skill, and stage mock battles. Those desiring to join their ranks are given a chance to demonstrate their prowess, usually with wooden practice weapons in contests against veteran soldiers. Makers and vendors of weapons sell their wares openly in the markets, experts who can hurl or juggle weapons show off their skills, and the wards compete in wrestling and boxing matches. The most anticipated part of the day is when horses are cleared from the Field of Triumph and the surrounding streets so that the Griffon Cavalry can perform aerial displays over the crowds in the stadium. Members of the Watchful Order present the cavalry with illusory foes to fight, allowing the griffon riders to engage in thrilling battles as the people watch.</p><h4>Marpenoth 3: Day of Wonders</h4><p>The imaginative inventions of the Gondar are revealed on this day and paraded through the city. These devices range from something as humble as new cabinet hinges to massive mechanical constructs that walk or roll about. Failure is the paramour of invention, though, meaning it is a rare year when there isn't some notable disruption of the celebration. The flying chair of Marchell was one such recent oddity—a device that worked marvelously on the way up but was incapable of descending. Marchell was rescued by the Griffon Cavalry, but his flying chair drifted away and was never seen again.</p><h4>Marpenoth 7: Stoneshar</h4><p>Stoneshar is an all-faiths day during which folk strive not to be idle. Even children at play are encouraged to dig holes, build sand castles, or construct crude models.</p><p>Waterdavians consider Stoneshar the best day of the year to begin construction of a building, either by digging out a cellar or laying a foundation. The common wisdom is that folk who undertake new projects on Stoneshar can expect blessings upon their works in the coming year, whereas individuals who do nothing constructive on this day can expect all manner of misfortune to rain down on them in the year ahead.</p><h4>Marpenoth 10: Reign of Misrule</h4><p>Swift on the heels of Stoneshar comes the Reign of Misrule. This day honors Beshaba, goddess of misfortune. People of the city are expected to break trust, belie oaths, and disobey the normal order—as long as no laws are actually broken and no rift is made that can't be later bridged. During the Reign of Misrule, nobles serve meals to their servants, children take control of schools, priests give worship to their god's foes, and any who wish to may participate in a guild's trade. Pranks are played by and on many, from simple tricks to those requiring elaborate planning. Sundown brings an end to the festivities, and most folk spend much of the night cleaning and reordering things for the following day. Many visitors decline to participate, but doing so often inspires misfortune rather than avoiding it. For fear of catching the bad luck of cynics, citizens do their best to avoid talking to anyone known to not have played along, or dealing with them in any way until Gods' Day.</p><h4>Marpenoth 15: Gods' Day</h4><p>This holiday observes the anniversary of the end of the Godswar in 1358 DR, when the gods of Faerûn returned to the heavens. Private shrines are brought out into the open, and many people wear holy symbols of their favored deities. A Gods' Day tradition in Waterdeep strictly limits the use of magic, in remembrance of the wild magic wrought during the Time of Troubles. Though not outlawed fully, spellcasting is allowable only in self-defense or in cases of extreme need.</p><p>At night, this holiday becomes solemn and serious, as many Waterdavians offer prayers in thanks for the lives they have under their gods. The Griffon Cavalry sets up an immense bonfire at the peak of Mount Waterdeep, honoring the fallen and the risen gods Myrkul, Cyric, Kelemvor, Mystra, Helm, and Ao who appeared here. In thanks for their defense during Myrkul's invasion and the resulting fires that raged through the Southern, Dock, and Castle Wards, Gods' Day is also a semiofficial “Be Kind to the Guard and Watch Day” in Waterdeep. Feel free to participate by handing out small gifts and kind words, but be aware that any gift of greater value than a few nibs might be interpreted as a bribe.</p><h4>Marpenoth 30: Liar's Night</h4><p>This holy day pays tribute to Leira and Mask. To placate those deities and ward away their attention, folk of all walks of life don masks and costumes (magical or mundane) to disguise themselves and play at being other than what they are. Commonly seen mask styles include the black mask symbol of Mask and the mirror face of the priests of Leira. But there are no bounds on the disguise you don, and the more elaborate and outlandish it is, the more celebrated the wearer.</p><p>The festivities begin in the evening, when people place candles in hollowed-out gourds or pumpkins carved with faces. Each pumpkin represents a person donning a mask, while the light inside represents the truth of the soul. For as long as the candle remains lit, lies told and embarrassing things done don't sully a person's reputation, so celebrations often descend briefly into anarchic hedonism.</p><p>Misfortune is said to come to anyone who returns to their pumpkin after celebrating to find it unlit, so buy a candle of good quality and put your gourd beyond reach of the wind. Intentionally blowing out someone else's candle or smashing someone else's pumpkin is taboo, and risks the wrath of both gods—yet it does occur.</p><p>Tricks and pranks of all kinds are common on this night, and folk expect lies and foolishness. Pickpockets are rife on this day, so few carry much coin with them, having secreted it away somewhere the previous evening. Instead, people fill their pockets and belt pouches with candies. Traditionally, a pickpocket is meant to take the candy and leave a token in return (a tiny toy, a colorful paper folded into a shape, or the like), but this has changed over the years into adults exchanging candies among themselves and simply giving candy to children who ask for it.</p><p>By custom, no deals are made nor contracts signed on Liar's Night, because no one trusts that parties will abide by them. Illusionists and stage magicians (whether through magical or practical abilities) make the rounds to entertain private parties (having been paid in advance the previous day) or to perform in public spaces, in the hopes that a good show will earn them a meal, and perhaps a place at a private party in the future.</p><h4>Uktar: Selûne's Hallowing</h4><p>On whatever night in Uktar the moon is fullest, Waterdavians celebrate Selûne's Hallowing. The goddess is the focus of worship throughout the full phase, of course, but the major ceremony on this night is a parade of worshipers leaving the House of the Moon at moonrise and moving down to the harbor, where the high priestess wields the <i>Wand of the Four Moons</i> in a ceremony blessing all navigators. This holy relic is said to be the mace wielded by Selûne in her first battle against Shar, and again in a fight with her sister during the Time of Troubles. It miraculously appeared in Waterdeep after the Godswar, and has since been the focus of many divine signs. You can view it in the House of the Moon at other times of the year, but only from a well-guarded distance.</p><p>If you're lucky, you might see the <i>Wand of the Four Moons</i> weep. Droplets said to be the tears of Selûne manifest on the mace from time to time, and are collected by the priestesses for use in potions that can heal, cure lycanthropy, and be used as holy water.</p><h4>Uktar 20: Last Sheaf</h4><p>Sometimes called “The Small Feast,” this day of residential feasting is held in celebration of the year's bounty. Small gifts (traditionally hand kegs of ale, jars of preserves, or smoked fish and meats) are exchanged among neighbors, and “last letters” are gathered for carriage by ship captains and caravan merchants—so called because they are the last to leave the city before travel becomes difficult. Of Waterdeep's many celebrations, this one is perhaps the most relaxed and relaxing. Plan to spend a little extra on good food and enjoy a meal with those nearest you, be they dearest hearts or the folk across the hall in the inn.</p><h4>Nightal 11: Howldown</h4><p>In honor of Malar, members of the City Guard leave the city in groups on this day to hunt down known threats to farmers and travelers, including brigands, wolves, owlbears, ogres, and trolls that haunt the roads and wilderness. These hunts typically last no longer than a tenday. During the same span of time, the City Watch engages in its own rigorous hunt for malefactors within the city walls. If you've any reason to doubt your standing in the eyes of the law, avoid Waterdeep for at least a tenday after Howldown.</p><p>With no real hunting to do of their own, the children of Waterdeep spend Howldown engaging in mock hunts of adults dressed up as monsters, and play at the killing of these predators.</p><h4>Nightal 20: Simril</h4><p>When dusk comes on this day, folk go outside to locate particular stars that were lucky for their ancestors, or that were associated with their own births. They then attempt to stay up through the night, celebrating outside with bonfires, song, and warmed drinks. Cloudy nights often draw larger crowds than clear ones, since glimpsing your star through the haze is thought to be a blessing from Tymora. Inside buildings, service folk keep roaring fires and engage in making food to keep celebrants fed throughout the long night and into morning of the next day. If you have no particular star of your own, you'll find many vendors of star maps willing to divine which is yours—based upon your place and date of birth—and to point you in the right direction for a shard or two.</p>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/005_-_Volo_27s_Waterdeep_Enchiridion/005_-_The_City_27s_Splendors/avatar.png"}

In other cities, such as Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter, districts are bounded by rivers or walls. But in Waterdeep, one can traverse from ward to ward by crossing a street—a fact that offers the drivers of hire-coaches some amusement when an ignorant tourist requests a ride to an adjacent ward.</p><p>Each ward has its own history, legends, and traditions based around who lived there in the past, famous or infamous events, and the uncanny things that continue to occur. For example, children (and even some adults) hop on one foot when crossing Asmagh's Alley in the Castle Ward. Why? Well, Asmagh was an apothecary who poisoned many patients, then buried them upright beneath the alley under cover of night. He was discovered, and some say that as many as eighty bodies were subsequently pulled up from holes under the alley's wide flagstones. Though this happened over a century ago, children passing through the alley still sing a song: “Hop for the hollows, hop for the dead, hop on the flagstones, hop on their heads.” As you stroll down Warrior's Way or the Street of Silver, listen for the children's delighted screams and go give it a try.</p><p>These shared stories and traditions impart to each ward a different culture, just as much as distinctions of class and wealth. Yet nothing drives residents to identify with their wards as much as festivals and sport. Nearly every race and parade in the city features a competition between wards as part of the festivities. On such days, homes and businesses fly the colors of their wards, trot out their mascots, and sing rousing songs that celebrate where they live. If you stay in the city for even a month, you're sure to see some version of this display of civic spirit.</p><p><b>Speak like a Native<br></b>The many idioms and slang expressions of Waterdavians would take a whole book to explore, but here I explain a few that might otherwise mystify.</p><p><b>“Dabbler but no master” and “No mastery blazing forth”<br></b>These idioms trace their origin to Ahghairon, who early on in his studies of magic humbly said, “I am no wizard. I am a dabbler but no master of magic; it seems no mastery burns within me.” Both now serve as expressions of false modesty applied to any skill or craft, not just magic use.</p><p><b>“Sharpjaws,” “fastfists,” “bullyblades,” and “alleyblades”<br></b>Those who boast of martial skill but who shrink from violence or lack real ability are “sharpjaws.” In sharp contrast are Waterdeep's “fastfists” (any lout easily provoked to violence), “bullyblades” (battle-hardened mercenaries hired as muscle), and “alleyblades” (muggers and thieves).</p><p><b>“Longride” and “Last ride”<br></b>To a caravan merchant, a drover, or a farmer from the lands around Waterdeep, as well as any Waterdavian who rides for sport, recreation, hunting, or falconry, the late afternoon is “longride,” and dusk is “last ride.”</p><p><b>“Which the greater thief?”<br></b>Tuezaera Hallowhand was a famous “lone cat” thief of Waterdeep in the 1200s DR, who disappeared suddenly and is thought to have come to a violent end. She once robbed a wizard and wrote this on his wall with a fingertip dipped in his favorite red wine: “I take things. You take freedom with your spells. Which of us is the greater thief?” Waterdavians now use this phrase in argument with one another over all kinds of matters when comparing wrongs done.</p><p><b>“Doth thy mirror crack?” or “Hurl but think not?” or “Take but not count cost? Be nothing, then!”<br></b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWM1M2NkZmE0YmI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Laeral Silverhand</a>, then the Lady Mage of Waterdeep when she was married to Khelben “Blackstaff” Arunsun, once publicly rebuked an overambitious wizard of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors thusly: “If I hurl spells but think not of consequences, I am nothing. If I take lives but count not the cost, I am nothing. If I steal in the night and see not the faces of the devastated come the next morning, I am nothing. If I make decrees like a ruler but undertake none of the other responsibilities of the throne, I am nothing. And if I do all these things in the name of the Watchful Order, I am less than nothing. Doth thy mirror crack?”</p><p>These scornful words are remembered and used almost daily in Waterdeep even a century later.</p><h4><b>Major Temples of Waterdeep</b></h4><table class=\"userscript-table userscript-table-bordered\"><thead><tr><th>Deity or Deities</th><th>Temple Name</th><th>Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>All deities<br></td><td>Holyhands House<br></td><td>North Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>All elven deities<br></td><td>Temple of the Seldarine<br></td><td>Castle Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Gond<br></td><td>House of Inspired Hands<br></td><td>Sea Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Helm<br></td><td>Helm’s Hall<br></td><td>Southern Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Ilmater<br></td><td>Hospice of St. Laupsenn<br></td><td>North Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Lathander<br></td><td>Spires of the Morning<br></td><td>Castle Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Mielikki, Silvanus<br></td><td>Shrines of Nature<br></td><td>Sea Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Mystra<br></td><td>House of Wonder<br></td><td>Sea Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Oghma<br></td><td>Font of Knowledge<br></td><td>Castle Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Selûne<br></td><td>Tower of the Moon<br></td><td>Sea Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Sune<br></td><td>Temple of Beauty<br></td><td>Sea Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Tempus<br></td><td>House of Heroes<br></td><td>Sea Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Tymora<br></td><td>Tower of Luck<br></td><td>Castle Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Tyr<br></td><td>Halls of Justice<br></td><td>Castle Ward<br></td></tr><tr><td>Umberlee<br></td><td>The Queenspire<br></td><td>Beach<br></td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Sea Ward</span></h3><p>The Sea Ward stands proud on the high ground above Mount Waterdeep's sunset shadow. The rich and the powerful (or those who wish you to think such of them, and can afford the rent) reside or run their businesses here. When the warlords and pirates of early Waters Deep gained enough gold, they built fortresses on what used to be fields of grass tousled by sea wind. You can still see the remains of some of those old castles incorporated into the palatial homes of the noble families that dwell in the Sea Ward. For the best all-around view of the glittering homes enshrouded by garden walls, go to where Diamond Street and Delzorin Street cross, nigh to Mystra's House of Wonder, and simply spin in a circle.</p><p>Blue and gold are the Sea Ward's colors in competitions, and the ward's mascot is the sea lion—a fanciful combination of fish and feline. There's a persistent but patently false legend that the famous Lion Gate at the Field of Triumph is the gaping maw of a sea lion. The architectural designs for the gates show this to be false, however, and they can be viewed in the Map House—the guildhall of the Surveyors', Map-, and Chart-makers' Guild in the Castle Ward.</p><p>Must-see locations in the Sea Ward begin, of course, with the Field of Triumph, but just across the street is the no less remarkable House of Heroes—the largest temple in the city. Dedicated to Tempus, its many grand halls celebrate the city's champions of both battle and sport. The winners of ward competitions are paraded here after their victories, often carried on shoulders or passed from hand to hand over the heads of a crowd. It is a sight you shouldn't miss.</p><p>You should also visit the House of Wonder. This is surely the most splendid temple dedicated to the gods of magic—with Mystra foremost among them, of course—in all the world. Although your eye will be drawn to its ornate towers, brilliant mosaics, and magical displays, look also for the humble violets growing amid the ostentation. These delicate flowers were Ahghairon's favorite, and they are planted about the temple in memory of him.</p><p>Two other temples in the ward are as impressive, but in different ways. The beauteous House of the Moon has the tallest tower of any temple in the city, rising some seventy-five feet above the street. At its top, priests of Selûne bask in the light of the moon in all seasons. The House of Inspired Hands, dedicated to Gond, presents an altogether less peaceful experience. Here, all the great innovative minds of the city invent and experiment, attempting to create everything from flying machines to stronger door hinges. But don't expect a museum of marvels such as can be found in Baldur's Gate. At this site, “worship is work,” as anyone at the temple is liable to tell you.</p><p>If you're looking for some good fortune, you should surely visit the Tower of Luck, a temple complex dedicated to Tymora. The “tower” in question is actually a many-pillared atrium ingeniously roofed over with glass. Beneath the roof, a bronze sculpture of a diminutive Tymora, depicted as a laughing young girl, appears to be leaping from the very top of an astounding fountain. To pay your respects and make a wish, you come around to the fountain on a walkway and toss your coin to Tymora. Managing to land it in her outstretched hand is a sure sign of her favor.</p><p>If you need to refresh yourself during your travels, or perhaps to primp before an important meeting or a night out, visit Sune's faithful at the Temple of Beauty. Its marbled public baths and mirrored salons are open from before dawn to after dusk. There's no fee for these services, or for the advice and aid of the temple's many pleasant attendants, but donations are encouraged.</p><p>Two parks in the Sea Ward might also be worth your time. The Shrines to Nature, just a block away from the Tower of Luck, are resplendent gardens dedicated to nature gods like Mielikki and Silvanus. The park is closed to all except residents of the Sea Ward. Yet from beyond the iron fence that surrounds it, you can catch glimpses of the superb shrines, statues, and fountains within. The Heroes' Garden is the only green space in the city that is open to the public besides the City of the Dead, but it is tucked away so far to the north in the Sea Ward that it gets few visitors—which is a pity, since the fine statuary in this lush garden portrays many of the figures important to the city's history.</p><p>I hesitate to mention a last location in the Sea Ward, and I will not reveal where to find it, for reasons that will soon become apparent. There is a house in the Sea Ward without windows or doors. You can't see it from the street, and those who live near it will not speak of it to others. You'll know you are near it when you see blue tiles on the streets and walls leading into an alley that passes under the surrounding buildings. At night, these tiles glimmer dimly with the blue light of foxfire. More than one route leads into the Blue Alley, as this place is known, but there are precious few ways out. Most who enter don't come back. If you see blue tiles, turn around and walk away before it is too late.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">North Ward</span></h3><p>Nobles aplenty live in the North Ward, but the character of this ward is more peaceful than that of the Sea Ward. Though it has taverns and shops to suit a variety of tastes, the tenor of the area tends toward reserved and polite. Most streets are lined with row houses inhabited by the families of prosperous people of business, investing, and civic service. They are each wealthy enough to employ a servant or two, or they endeavor to appear as such.</p><p>For the best experience in the North Ward, go there just before dawn, buy a broadsheet, and settle in at a café with a view of the street. Watch as the ward comes quietly to life around you. At first, it will be so silent that you'll be able to hear the resident a street over who opens her sash for fresh air and clears her throat. Then the birdsong will begin, and shortly thereafter, you'll hear and then see the drays arriving with servants. These aren't the live-in staff used by noble houses, but people hired to come and work for a day. Most of them come from less affluent parts of the city, arriving with the tools of their trade and outfitted in their customary garb: launderers and cooks in white, chimney sweeps and housecleaners in black, valets and child-minders in gray, gardeners in green, and tutors in blue.</p><p>As these servants spread out to knock on doors and begin their work, the residents of the ward take their exits, parting fondly with spouses and children, their footsteps tramping along the sidewalks or taking them into rattling hire-coaches. In the span of just an hour, the North Ward comes to noisy life and then settles again into quiescence, until later in the day when the process reverses itself, as residents return from work and servants leave.</p><p>The liveliest, and perhaps the loveliest, part of the ward is the Cliffwatch. Here, the plateau upon which Waterdeep sits features cliffs so steep and high that the city wall is interrupted to either side of them. Some of the most lavish residences and most luxurious taverns and inns of Waterdeep stand along this space, boasting terraces and balconies that allow one to take in the beautiful sight of the countryside to the east. Yet you need not pay their high prices, for a public walkway along the cliff's edge offers pedestrians ample opportunity to enjoy the view.</p><p>The North Ward's colors are green and orange, and its mascot is the gentle white dove, depicted in flight. Many North Ward homes have dovecotes on their roofs, and the great flocks of the birds that circle over the city at dawn and dusk are a delight to behold.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Castle Ward</span></h3><p>The Castle Ward is the heart and mind of Waterdeep, if not its soul. It houses the city's military forces, courts, government, and the Market—the largest market square of any city in the North. It encompasses the City Navy's docks in the Great Harbor and all of Mount Waterdeep, and it is home to six walking statues, numerous temples, and many other landmarks.</p><p>Castle Waterdeep stands above the city on a great bluff that extends out from the mountain, its towers soaring hundreds of feet into the sky. It surprises many to learn that this isn't where Waterdeep's rulers reside, nor from where the city is governed. The castle was and is a redoubt of last defense should the city be attacked, but for well over a century, the ruler of Waterdeep has occupied the Palace of Waterdeep—also known as Piergeiron's Palace, and still called that by elderly and long-lived citizens (including many elves).</p><p>Though not quite as large as the castle, the palace is far more comfortable and lavishly decorated, with many halls used by government officials, guildmasters, and nobles for meetings and court proceedings. If you have reason to be invited (not compelled, I should hope!) to meet with the Masked Lords or the Open Lord of Waterdeep, it will likely take place in the audience chamber of the palace. There, you can witness the ancient and humble throne that Ahghairon first sat upon so long ago.</p><p>Many other buildings in the ward are given over to city business, including several courts for magisters and the barracks of the City Guard. So many of the ward's structures are offices and meeting halls for business owners, solicitors, publishers, and the like that the Castle Ward has the smallest resident population of all the wards.</p><p>Many landmarks of interest are found in this ward aside from the six walking statues (discussed later in this chapbook). You could hardly see them all in a day, but the following are highly recommended.</p><p>Blackstaff Tower is a squat black blot in the otherwise pretty ward. Humble though the edifice might be, looking at the place for too long can give you a queasy feeling and the sense that you are being watched—almost as if the tower itself has turned an unseen and wrathful eye upon you. Perhaps you think this fanciful. Well, go and try it yourself!</p><p>On the opposite end of the mountain, close to the Naval Harbor, stands Mirt's Mansion. Once a fortress-like and glowering tower, it has been upgraded with more delicate fashions of architecture since the return of its long-absent owner.</p><p>Mirt has quite a history with Durnan, the proprietor of the Yawning Portal. Together they descended into “the Well,” as the entrance to Undermountain was known in olden days. Waterdeep used to throw criminals in the Well, leaving them to die horribly in Undermountain's dungeons. Durnan and Mirt entered the dungeons of their own free will—and not only that, but returned laden with treasures. Both used magic to extend their lives, but they eventually parted ways. Mirt kept on with a life of adventure, while Durnan built the tavern called the Yawning Portal over the Well and now, almost two centuries later, charges coin to descend into it. Not a bad way to part fools from their money!</p><p>The glorious Spires of the Morning, dedicated to Lathander, is one of Waterdeep's most beautiful temples. But it is rivaled in this ward by the Temple of the Seldarine, dedicated to all the elf gods. The journey through Mount Melody Walk, a tunnel cut through Mount Waterdeep, to New Olamn's academy of music and other arts is a wondrous daytime excursion. The Market offers a wild array of sights, smells, and sounds in which folk might lose themselves for a tenday. The Font of Knowledge is a temple to Oghma, yes, but also the city's largest public library. Titles written throughout the ages can be viewed here—under the watchful eyes of the temple's priests. In short (if I can claim this section of the enchiridion to be such), the Castle Ward offers far too many splendors to list them all here.</p><p>The Castle Ward's colors are blue and purple, and its mascot is a griffon, typically depicted in gold. These borrow colors from the city's flag and reference the Griffon Cavalry, of course. Champions for the ward often come from among the ranks of the Guard, the Navy, or the Cavalry. Although such competitors have often have the advantage in races and competitions, their crowds of rabidly cheering fans are naturally much smaller than those of other wards.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Trades Ward</span></h3><p>Shopping, shopping, shopping galore! Or eating, eating, eating! Or drinking, drinking, drinking! Or lavish accommodations, or fine art, or legendary parties! The Market in the Castle Ward is the largest market square in the city, but the Trades Ward is like a market town in itself—and is easily thrice the Market's size.</p><p>This ward bustles day and night with activity, both on the street and on balcony walkways that run the length of blocks and are sometimes layered five stories high. Shop signs appear to leap out from buildings, whose sides are plastered with advertisements all vying for the attention of the eye. Glove shops, shoe shops, jewelry stores, perfumeries, flower shops, cake shops, taverns, cafés, tea shops, inns, row houses, boarding schools, offices, dance academies, grocers, pottery stores, armor vendors—as long as it's not illegal, you can find it in the Trades Ward. But if you are looking for something illegal, the Trades Ward is likely the place to get that too.&nbsp;</p><p>Do not do so too loudly, though. The City Watch has a heavy presence in this ward, in the form of both open patrols and officers working out of uniform.</p><p>As befits a place of so much business, many guilds have their halls in this ward. Of particular note is the House of Light, the hall of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters. Outside the building, a wagon-sized mound of wax with hundreds of wicks is kept lit day and night, while being continually built up with adhered candles. Inside, the best works of the guild are put on display and sold, including not just candles of various colors, lamps, and chandeliers, but elaborate waxwork constructions that depict all sorts of subjects from personages of note, to dragons, to complex and abstract lattices—all represented as fantastical candles.</p><p>Magic users should be wary in the Court of the White Bull. Long ago, this plaza was a grazing area for livestock, including an albino calf that was born here. The calf's owner built the White Bull Tavern, which thrived on the spot for years and gave the area its name. You'll not find the tavern now, though. It vanished, utterly destroyed during an infamous spell battle between the archmage Thongalar the Mighty and the evil mage Shile Rauretilar and his apprentices. In the storm of magic that touched down here, Shile and his apprentices all perished and the fabric of the Weave was rent, such that Azuth, god of wizards, was forced to appear and set things right. He is said to have stitched reality and the Weave back together, but a wrinkle in the fabric remains. To this day, magic brought to bear in the Court of the White Bull sometimes goes awry, and the use of magic items and spells is forbidden in the area.</p><p>The Trades Ward uses green and purple as its colors, and its mascot is the mimic. This tradition supposedly arose because when mascots were first chosen, the Trades Ward took a chest of gold as its own—and was roundly mocked by citizens of other wards for not picking a creature. Now, every four years, the ward reveals a new object for its mascot, declaring it to be the mimic. The nature of the object is subject to much speculation and rumor until its unveiling. For months afterward, the object becomes the source of practical jokes in Waterdeep. Rock gnomes and wizards cause illusory mouths to lunge from real versions of the object, artisans craft beautiful fakes out of cake or paper that are easily crushed when assumed to be real, and so on. As of the writing of this enchiridion, the current mimic is a tankard.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Southern Ward</span></h3><p>It is called the Southern Ward, not the South Ward. Waterdavians are peculiar about this, and if you insist on referring to it as the South Ward, expect to be corrected or thought a fool. The name derives not merely from its southerly location in the city, but from the southerners who settled in this district as the city grew. Today, the ward still hosts most of the traveling merchants who visit the city, and is made up of many enclaves, blocks, and streets primarily occupied by citizens who trace their ancestry to other realms.</p><p>One can indulge in the finest halfling food here, enjoy the best singers of Calishite music, and examine the most stunning works of dwarven crafting—but the first challenge is finding where these treats are housed. The Southern Ward has long been a district of laborers catering to travelers, so its folk have adopted the architectural custom of building homes and businesses above stables or around inn yards, near to where wagon trains are housed.</p><p>Residents of the Southern Ward take pride in their legacy as overland travelers and hardworking folk, so it should be no surprise that the ward's mascot is the mule. On their competition flags, a pugnacious mule in rampant pose stands on a field of red and white—colors said to represent the blood and tears the people of the Southern Ward have shed during their labors.</p><p>Not a landmark as such, but surely a sight that must be seen, is the Moon Sphere. This isn't a structure but an event that occurs during every full moon, when a glowing, spherical field of blue light appears in the square known as the Dancing Court. Any creatures that enter the sphere find that they can fly about inside it just by willing themselves to do so. For centuries, Waterdavians have used these supernatural events to develop a unique flying style of dance—but amateur enthusiasts aren't welcome, except on certain daylight appearances of the full moon.</p><p>Even when the full moon isn't out, the Dancing Court is worth visiting because of the adjacent festhall, the Jade Dancer. During appearances of the Moon Sphere, people sometimes daringly leap into the field of magic from the balconies of this three-story tavern, dance hall, and inn. But the festhall takes its name from a peculiar dancer within it rather than those in the court outside. The “Jade Dancer” is an eight-foot-tall jade statue of a woman that magically animates and dances for patrons—and on occasion serves as a bouncer. Elminster has informed me that despite its dexterity and seemingly fragile beauty, the Jade Dancer is as puissant as a stone golem. So enjoy the show, but don't get too rowdy.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Dock Ward</span></h3><p>The Dock Ward was long considered the most dangerous district in the city, but the Field Ward has since taken that title. I don't doubt the residents of the Dock Ward are glad of it, for in some respects this area has never truly deserved its bad reputation.</p><p>Yes, aside from the Field Ward, this is the area where most of Waterdeep's poor reside. Yes, it is home to some of the least literate people in the city. Yes, most of its taverns are inhabited by habitual drinkers, and far too many inns charge by the hour. But all must concede this: the residents of the Dock Ward often work the hardest while living under the harshest conditions.</p><p>Warehouses, poorhouses, and tenements dominate much of the area. Streets are steep throughout, and few have space alongside for pedestrians. Wandering through the ward can be a bewildering journey without a guide. Except in the immediate vicinity of the piers, shop signs and advertising of any kind are rare, and warehouses and other businesses often have no sign at all. You either know where you are going and have reason to be there—or you are lost, and a likely mark for pickpockets or worse.</p><p>Streetlamps don't fare well in the Dock Ward. Their candles, oils, and glass are too regularly stolen or smashed. The Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters makes a halfhearted attempt to repair the streetlamps at the start of each season, but for most of the year, locals are forced to carry their own light when traveling these streets at night.</p><p>The colors of the Dock Ward are burgundy and orange, and its mascot is a swordfish that has always been depicted as green for reasons lost to time. The folk of the Dock Ward take competition seriously, and they frequently draft their champions from the rough-and-tumble sailors who come to the city. (Some say they draft pirates, but that is pure slander.) Frequent complaints arise that these women and men are more citizens of the sea than of the Dock Ward itself. But if they register with a magister and pay taxes, they are as welcome to compete as any long-term resident of Waterdeep.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">City of the Dead</span></h3><p>I could write a book about the City of the Dead. It is such a fascinating place, filled with so much history and so many stories. But alas, there would be few buyers for <i>Volo's Guide to the City of the Dead</i>, since it would be of interest mainly to Waterdavians—and the topic is one about which they are already intimately knowledgeable.</p><p>The City of the Dead is no drab cemetery. It is a great park of grassy hills, tended flower beds, artfully placed clusters of trees and bushes, beautiful sculptures, astounding architecture, and gravel paths that wend intriguingly through it all. Long ago, Waterdavians largely abandoned the practice of burying their dead, instead entombing them in mausoleums. For centuries, the major mausoleums here have each been connected to an extradimensional space where the dead are taken, mourned, and interred.</p><p>Those who can afford it memorialize the departed with sculptures, making the City of the Dead an open-air museum that features some of the most stunning, haunting, mournful, and downright eerie statues ever crafted in marble or bronze. Nobles and wealthy merchants have competed to erect the grandest markers for their dead, leading to a wide variety of styles and concepts created by artists at the height of their skills.</p><p>One of the cemetery's most impressive attractions is the Warriors' Monument. This intricate, sixty-foot-high sculpture depicts a circle of women and men striking down trolls, orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears, and barbarians, all of which are falling backward and outward around the warriors. Above all of them, a flying griffon rider spears a skeletal knight whose breastplate bears the symbol of Myrkul, god of the dead. But this statue is also a fountain, and the wounds on these combatants gush water! Don't try to imagine it—just go see it. And see it as Waterdavians do: pack a midday feast, have a picnic, and then take a stroll through the beauty of the place.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Outside the City Proper</span></h3><p>There's more to the city of Waterdeep than just the wards within its walls. If you have need to visit the environs of the city, here's what you'll need to know.</p><h4>Field Ward</h4><p>This district was once a caravan yard between Waterdeep's two northernmost walls, kept free of settlement to serve as a killing field in times of war. As refugees from various calamities settled there after not being allowed into the city's wealthy northern neighborhoods, the area has grown up into a lawless town of its own.</p><p>Though not an official ward of the city, the Field Ward is commonly referred to as one. The Watch doesn't patrol this area, however, and many crimes go uninvestigated. The City Guard oversees the Field Ward from the walls around it, but its members get involved only when folk moving into or out of the city are threatened.</p><p>The area is a muddy mess, populated by the poorest people and those who take advantage of those folks' desperation. It has no sewer system and isn't served by the Dungsweepers' Guild—a fact that will be quite evident to your nose if you venture here. I don't recommend that you spend any more time here than it takes to pass through from one gate to the next.</p><p>The Guild of Butchers operates several slaughterhouses, smokehouses, and leather-making facilities in the area—noisome operations that have been pushed out of the city proper. A word to the wise: being friendly with a burly fellow who is good with a knife is one of your best defenses in the Field Ward. The other place you might solicit aid is Endshift Tavern, a popular stop for off-duty members of the City Guard, situated on the corner of Endshift Street and the Breezeway. Though the guards might not be inclined to assist you, your status as a visitor to Waterdeep technically obliges them to help you reach the city proper in safety.</p><h4>Undercliff</h4><p>This area of rolling grassland and small wooded areas east of the city is a rural community focused on farming and animal husbandry, and which caters to travelers. It is also the site of a large and well-protected training camp for the City Guard, and a prison farm run by the City Watch (called Amendsfarm) where those convicted of minor offenses work off their debt to the city. Many gnomes and halflings live in this region, and most buildings are built to reflect their stature.</p><p>Two noble families have estates in Undercliff. The Amcathra estate is used for the housing and final training of horses bred in the town of Amphail, many of which are sold to the City Guard. The Hothemer noble house has an estate where its members conduct business in overland trade—beyond the reach of Waterdeep's auditors.</p><p>If you visit this area, I recommend the Snobeedle Orchard and Meadery, owned and run by the Snobeedle halflings. They have a delightful drinking hall and a shop sized for larger patrons, and you can pick your own fruit when it is in season.</p><h4>Undermountain</h4><p>Tales of this legendary dungeon below Waterdeep are told well by many in the city, but I'll provide you with the basic truths here.</p><p>Beneath the plateau of Waterdeep lies the largest and deepest dungeon in the world. It sprawls out under the city, said to plunge as many as twenty levels deep. The Melairkyn dwarves first excavated the tunnels that would become Undermountain, and the drow are said to have dug their own tunnels up from below. All were claimed, altered, and expanded by the mad wizard Halaster and his apprentices—who are believed to dwell in the dungeons to this day. What drove them deep into the earth remains a mystery, but Undermountain's allure is a siren song that still draws many. If you want to see adventurers descend into the depths, or perhaps glimpse some returning with wondrous treasures, visit the Yawning Portal in the Castle Ward.</p><p><b>The Wonders of the Waymoot<br></b>The place where the High Road and the Way of the Dragon meet in the south of the city is called the Waymoot. At the center of the crossroads, a high signpost stands with hanging arrows pointing toward the harbor and each of the city gates. Created by the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors and funded by local merchants, the signpost magically directs travelers to well-known distant locations when the names of those locations are spoken into a crystal on the post. The magic of the Waymoot writes the destination onto the proper arrow of the signpost and indicates its distance from Waterdeep in miles. Folk are thereby sent out of the harbor or the appropriate gate leading north, east, or south, depending on their destination.</p><p>Unfortunately for newcomers, the Waymoot is of no use whatsoever in finding locations within Waterdeep. You will, however, find a number of enterprising individuals near the crossroads who take advantage of this fact to offer their services as city guides. Though some reputable members of this cadre will guide you true for a fair fee, plenty of citizens with nothing to lose or gain by doing so will also readily set you on the right course if you're simply polite.</p>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/005_-_Volo_27s_Waterdeep_Enchiridion/004_-_The_Wards_of_Waterdeep/avatar.png"}

A member of the Guild of Butchers, Thrakkus has a lucrative side business. Zhents loyal to Manshoon pay Thrakkus to chop up people they kill, and he sells the meat on the sly. As Deadwinter Day approaches, this meat is in high demand. The corpses are brought to him in the dead of night, most often delivered by Sidra Romeir (see area K2) in a covered cart pulled by a draft horse.</span><p></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span></p><h4>Butchery</h4><p>A red wooden sign carved to look like a butcher's cleaver hangs above the door of Thrakkus's butchery, which occupies the westernmost room of the west wing. The butchery is ice cold in the winter and reeks of meat and blood. A bloodstained chopping block dominates the room, and shelves of cut meat wrapped in bloody parchment line the walls. The floor is streaked with blood and covered with bits of gore.<br><br>Thrakkus padlocks the door at night. Picking the lock requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The door can also be forced open with a successful DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check.<br><span style=\"font-family: inherit\"><br><b style=\"font-size: 14px\">Larder</b><span style=\"font-size: 14px\"><b><br></b></span></span>The chamber next to the butchery has been converted into a larder, the doors to which are padlocked at all hours. The locked doors are otherwise identical to the butchery door (see above). Like the butchery, the larder is frigid in the winter and smells of meat and blood. Six half-frozen humanoid carcasses are stacked under a 10-foot-square canvas tarpaulin near the western wall. Thrakkus hasn't gotten around to cutting them up yet.<br><span style=\"font-family: inherit\"><br><b style=\"font-size: 14px\">Squatters</b><span style=\"font-size: 14px\"><b><br></b></span></span>The dragonborn allows squatters to dwell in his home. Those who can perform menial chores are spared and fed scraps of cooked meat; the rest end up on the chopping block. These homeless sods are too frightened of Thrakkus to speak ill of him, and the City Watch doesn't seem to care about crimes committed in the Field Ward.<br><span style=\"font-family: inherit\"><br><b style=\"font-size: 14px\">Thrakkus the Butcher</b><span style=\"font-size: 14px\"><b><br></b></span></span>The butcher has no time to suffer fools, and the characters are fools for meddling in his business. <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2M0ZTczNTY0ZjZh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Thrakkus</a></b>&nbsp;spends most of the day in the butchery. At dusk, he retires to his apartment, where he stays until dawn or until someone comes knocking with a body to dispose of. Thrakkus carries keys to the butchery, the larder, and his apartment (area W7).<br><span style=\"font-family: inherit\"><br><b style=\"font-size: 14px\">Where's the Stone?</b><span style=\"font-size: 14px\"><b><br></b></span></span>Thrakkus hid the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> in a recent meat delivery to an alley in the Trades Ward. Thrakkus doesn't keep records of his illegal transactions, so the characters must interrogate him or one of the commoners that dwell in his residence.<br><br>Thrakkus is belligerent and not eager to give up his Zhent friends. A <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Charm%20Person#content\">charm person</a></i> spell or similar magic is needed to compel him to talk. His squatters are another matter; they roll over on Thrakkus quickly to save their own skins once the dragonborn butcher no longer becomes a factor in their well-being. Either approach yields the following information:</p><ul><li style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\">Thrakkus's last shipment of meat was taken to a shop in the Trades Ward called Cuttle's Meat Pies.

En route to that destination, the man had his hire-coach make a brief stop in the Castle Ward to drop off his lady friend. She now has the stone—a fact that characters can discover by questioning the man, a<b>&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE5M2E2NDQ4M2I3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bard</a></b> named Agorn Fuoco.<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br>Agorn made such a good impression on Manshoon that he was elevated quickly through the ranks of the organization, but his life is full of disappointment otherwise. He has not achieved the fame he craved nor earned the wealth he felt he was entitled to. He has adopted the Zhentarim credo that power comes to those who deserve it and has come to see the Black Network as a new family of sorts. Agorn has come to Mistshore to visit a member of his actual family—his mother, who is gravely ill and lives in abject poverty.<br></span><br></p><h4>A Waiting Coach</h4><p></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Waiting at the edge of the neighborhood is the hire-coach that bore Agorn Fuoco through the blizzard to Mistshore. Two draft horses stamp their hooves impatiently in the snow. The driver, Rowan Evenwood (LG female Chondathan human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b>), was paid extra to wait for Agorn to return. He left in a hurry, and she doesn't know how long she is expected to wait, but her patience has limits.<br></span><br></p><h4>A Cold Reception</h4>A blizzard is tearing through Mistshore, turning its rotten tenements into dark, looming shapes behind veils of blowing snow. The water around the docks is frozen solid, and impoverished <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></b> clad in tattered garments gather around sputtering campfires for warmth. These folk are suspicious of anyone they don't recognize and far from welcoming, even toward those who show them charity. These people would tear the clothes from the characters' backs given half a chance.<br><br><h4>Ice Escapades</h4>Playing on the ice underneath the docks are three street urchins wearing frayed cloaks and gloves. They dart in and out of view, hurling snowballs at each other and laughing as the blizzard batters the structures above them.<br><br>When the children (Nat, Jenks, and Squiddly) see the characters for the first time, their interest is piqued. The children fancy themselves adventurers of sorts, and they are quick to idolize and emulate real-life ones. Squiddly even has the audacity to hurl a snowball at one of them (+0 bonus to hit). The children know who Agorn Fuoco is because he used to live and play music in Mistshore. They offer to lead characters to his mother's residence.<br><br><h4>Mother and Son</h4>Pick one of the unmarked buildings on the Mistshore map to serve as the Fuoco residence. Agorn Fuoco (NE male Turami <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE5M2E2NDQ4M2I3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bard</a></b>) is inside, trying to smother his bedridden mother, Marta (N female Turami human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b> with 1 hit point), with a sack she uses as a pillowcase. With tears born of joy and sadness streaming down his face, Agorn is cutting loose his old family ties and embracing his new family: the Zhentarim. The characters can stop him from committing matricide by pulling him away from his mother before she suffocates.<br><br>Agorn was moved to perpetrate this act by the play he saw at the theater and by his lady friend, Amath Sercent, to whom he entrusted the<i> Stone of Golorr</i>. He won't give up her location willingly, though magic can be used to pry the information from his lips. Characters can also speak to the hire-coach driver, Rowan Evenwood, who dropped off Agorn's lady friend before transporting Agorn to Mistshore. Amath lives in an old tower in the Castle Ward called Yellowspire.<br><br><h4>Zhents in the Wind</h4>As the characters leave the Fuoco residence, with or without Agorn as their prisoner, they are surrounded by nine Zhentarim <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjOTkwZDcyZDUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>thugs</a></b>. The thugs fight to the death while Agorn tries to escape. If he gets away, the characters might encounter him again.<br><br>As the Zhents attack and Agorn attempts to flee, the characters hear a child's scream coming from the opposite direction. Through the blowing snow, they can see that one of the urchins, Jenks, has fallen through a thin patch of ice and is in danger of sinking to the bottom of the harbor. His two friends are trying to pull him out of the hole, but he's too heavy. The children are roughly 30 feet away. A character within arm's reach of Jenks can use an action to try to pull the boy from the cold water, doing so with a successful DC 11 Strength (Athletics) check. If no adult comes to Jenks's aid within 1 minute of his falling through the ice, he sinks below the surface and begins to drown as the cold water overcomes him.<br><br>If the characters find themselves outmatched by the Zhents, help comes in two forms. Two Harper <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Njk2ZmFjZTg1NTU4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>spies</a> </b>sent by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTE4YzIzZTdhMmQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Remallia Haventree</a> appear on the scene. Their names are Salazar Lorrance (CG male Tethyrian human) and Mavia Oxlander (NG female Chondathan human). If the battle doesn't turn quickly in the party's favor, Grinda Garloth (see area D2) appears and uses her magic to aid them.<br><br><h4>Next Encounter</h4>Armed with information from Agorn Fuoco or his hire-coach driver, the characters might feel compelled to pay a visit to Yellowspire in the Castle Ward.

The characters are unlikely to know it, but the Brandath family is an old one. Lord Dagult Neverember married into it for its wealth, and Lady Brandath gave birth to his son, Renaer. It's a dark irony that Neverember entrusted the location of his embezzled gold to his dead wife's family. Renaer Neverember would be horrified but not surprised to learn the truth.<br></span><br>The cemetery is buried in snow, and though some visitors are drawn to its scenic beauty even in winter, the blizzard keeps most of them away. The crumbling mausoleum is sealed tight, and the name BRANDATH is etched above its entrance. Large elm and birch trees grow around the structure, sheltering it as best they can with their leafless boughs.<br><br></p><h4>Guardian Treant</h4>The largest tree growing in front of the entrance is a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTczMTZhODNlNjJk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>treant</a></b>. It awakens when one or more creatures approach the entrance and growls, “Only those of Brandath blood are welcome here! Begone!” The treant is particularly surly, it being winter and all.<br><br>If someone other than a Brandath descendant tries to open the mausoleum, the treant animates two nearby trees (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2I2YzY3MzQ5Mzky ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>awakened trees</a></b>) and then attacks. The treant and its animated allies are too big to enter the mausoleum.<br><br>The characters can kill the treant, try to slip past it, or retreat until they learn more about the Brandath family. A day's research followed by a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the characters know one such person: Renaer Neverember. If they ask Renaer to admit them to the Brandath family mausoleum, he agrees to do so. Because the treant can sense that Renaer has Brandath blood in his veins, it allows him and those he calls his friends to enter unmolested, and says to Renaer in passing, “Your mother was a lovely person.”<br><br><h4>Glyph of Warding</h4>A glyph of warding spell has been cast on the first step leading down to the underground level, set to trigger when a humanoid creature passes over the step. The glyph can't be spotted unless the dust on the floor is cleared away by a gust of wind spell or some other means. Once the dust is swept aside, a character who searches the stairs notices the glyph with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.<br><br>If the glyph is triggered, it erupts with magical fire in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on it. The fire spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. The glyph disappears after it is triggered.<br><br><h4>Uld's Resting Place</h4>A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation that emanates from one of the stone coffins on the underground level. This crypt contains the shattered bones of Uld Brandath, a Waterdavian magister who died in a freak accident decades ago. (A gargoyle broke off the corner of a government building and fell on Uld, crushing him.) Guarding his remains are six <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2ViMjUxOWFiNTVi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>crawling claws</a></b> made from the hands of murderers who were sentenced to death by Uld. These undead hands spring out and attack when the lid is lifted or shoved aside.<br><br><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> Lying amid the bones is Uld's <i>headband of intellect</i>, which the characters can retrieve once the crawling claws are dealt with.<br><br><h4>Path to the Vault</h4>The collapsed eastern end of the underground level is actually an illusion that conceals an intact, 10-foot-wide passageway that slopes down. The characters can walk right through the illusion, which has no substance, and a <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Dispel%20Magic#content\">dispel magic</a></i> spell destroys it. The tunnel wends downward for several hundred feet, gradually widening to 20 feet where it ends at the doors to the Vault of Dragons.<p></p></section>","img":""}

But as is the way across the dangerous North, civilization at the foot of Mount Waterdeep has crested and ebbed in great waves. Elf scholars assure me that it was once the site of Aelinthaldaar, the capital of their ancient empire of Illefarn. So it was already a glorious place when a dwarf prospector named Melair discovered mithral beneath the mountain. In agreement with the Illefarni, Melair called kith and kin to mine under the mountain and in the plateau, and thus Clan Melairkyn came to rule below as the Illefarni did above.<br></p><p>But this fruitful alliance lasted less than the lifetime of a dwarf, for the emperor of the elves—what they call a “coronal”—commanded that all leave in the Retreat, that great exodus of elves from Faerûn to their mystical isle of Evermeet. Not all elves agreed with this edict, and many were determined to stay. Well, what emperor has ever willingly allowed another to sit in his throne? The coronal had all of Aelinthaldaar razed by magic, and the remaining elves splintered into separate kingdoms. The Melairkyn, of course, saw this as a breaking of their bargain, and never again did they deal with elves. Instead, they tunneled ever deeper under the mountain, never to be heard from again.</p><p>So it was that the humans who came to the deepwater harbor found it empty and suitable for their own purposes. For more than a thousand years, folk lived and traded at the site of what would become Waterdeep, but their identities remain a mystery—with a curious exception. We know that at some point during this period, the wizard Halaster Blackcloak built his tower at the base of Mount Waterdeep and came to rule the lands around—until he, like the Melairkyn, vanished under the mountain.</p><p>Various warlords later claimed the plateau's harbor as their own, but it was one known as Nimoar who is best remembered. <i>A History of Waterdeep: Age One, The Rise of the Warlord</i> records how Nimoar raised a wooden stockade to protect the settlement around the harbor, claiming rule over the town that by then was being called “Nimoar's Hold, the Town of Waters Deep.”</p><p>War between orcs and elves in lands farther north drove hordes of trolls south to claw at the fledgling city, and amid this danger, Nimoar died of old age. Many bloody struggles unfolded between local folk and trolls, until the magic of a youth named Ahghairon turned the fortunes of war against the “everlasting ones,” which were destroyed or scattered. Ahghairon improved slowly in skill and power with the passage of the years, until he became a great mage. He is said to have discovered a supply of <i>potions of longevity</i>, or learned the art of making such, for he lived on and on, still physically in his prime for decade after decade.</p><p><i>A History of Waterdeep: Age Two, The Lords' Rule Begins</i> records that in the year 1032 DR, Ahghairon (then in his 112th winter) argued with Raurlor, who was then Warlord of Waterdeep. Raurlor wanted to use Waterdeep's acquired wealth and strength of arms to create a northern empire. Ahghairon defied him before all the people, and Raurlor ordered the mage to be chained. But when Ahghairon magically turned aside all who sought to lay hands on him, Raurlor struck at the mage with his own sword. Ahghairon then rose into the air, just out of reach, and used his magic to transmute Raurlor's blade into a hissing serpent. When the serpent struck Raurlor, he died in full view of his shocked followers.</p><p>Ahghairon then gathered the leaders of Waterdeep's armies and powerful families. While runners sought to bring them to the castle, flames roared and crackled in the empty warlord's throne at Ahghairon's bidding, so that none could sit there. Then, when the gathered host of worthies met in the audience chamber, the wizard seated himself on the flaming throne. Immediately the fires died away, leaving both the throne and Ahghairon unharmed.</p><p>From this seat—the very one on which the Open Lord sits to this day—Ahghairon decreed how the city would be governed. While he would sit as lord openly, a council of other lords of nearly equal power would rule with him. But the identity of those other lords would be hidden even from each other, thus preventing any of them from being approached and influenced by bribe or threat. So it was that Ahghairon established Waterdeep's system of governance.</p><p>Ahghairon was instrumental in establishing many of Waterdeep's other institutions, such as its black-robed magisters, its Griffon Cavalry, and the city's many guilds. The first Open Lord ruled wisely for over two centuries before the magic sustaining his health failed. He now lies entombed in his tower, which you can still see standing in the courtyard of the Palace of Waterdeep. Beware that you don't approach too close, however, lest you stumble into the invisible barrier—a “force cage,” I am told—that surrounds the tower.</p><p>Within that barrier lie additional protective wards, as demonstrated by the floating bones of the last person who tried to defy them. The name of this poor soul has been lost to time, but the miscreant was likely a wizard who sought to steal the magic treasures that had been entombed with their former owner. Now they hang in the air beyond the invisible force cage in rough semblance of their natural position, occasionally displaced temporarily by strong winds or mischievous children with long sticks.</p><p>Ahghairon's wise rule is celebrated on the first day of Eleasis, which has come to be known as Ahghairon's Day. For more about this day, see “City Celebrations” in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWU5NTBlNmEyMWU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The City's Splendors</a>.</p><p>Many significant events stand out in Waterdeep's history. But none have had so great an effect on daily life than the three apocalyptic periods known as the Time of Troubles, the Spellplague, and the Sundering—the most recent (and hopefully final). On all these occasions, the actions of gods at war with one another led to the loss or the twisting of magic in the world. During the Time of Troubles, Waterdeep stood at the center of events. But the effects of the more recent crises can still be seen in the city today, even though they occurred a great distance from where Waterdeep stands.</p><p>When the gods walked among mortals during the Time of Troubles, they were cast down to the world by the mysterious Overgod Ao in 1358 DR. Until then, none but the gods had known of Ao's existence, and since then, we have learned little more. As all know, the crisis began with the theft of the <i>Tablets of Fate</i> by the vile and ambitious gods Bane and Myrkul, later joined by Bhaal. These mystic artifacts supposedly determine the extent of the gods' power, and dictate how they use that power. As punishment for this affront, Ao cast down the gods (or the ones that humans worshiped, at any rate) and then demanded that they return the tablets to him.</p><p>But Ao was not omniscient, it seems, nor overly wise. The gods didn't seek out the tablets, and thus it was left to mortal heroes to sort out the mess. They did so, their efforts culminating in Waterdeep. It was on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep that Ao was last seen, when he granted godhood to the human heroes Kelemvor, Midnight (who became Mystra), and Cyric.</p><p>It is no surprise, then, that Waterdeep has since attracted a steady stream of pilgrims who worship Midnight at Mystra's temple and pay homage to Kelemvor in the City of the Dead. It might surprise you, though, to learn that Waterdavians had a short-lived penchant for worshiping Ao. The Cynosure—that great marble-pillared structure on the edge of the Market, now rented out for private and public events—was built as a temple to Ao. But his worship fell from favor when all prayers to him went unanswered, and folk realized they had no idea what he stood for or who he was. You can visit the Cynosure to see sculptures and paintings of all the major participants and events in the Time of Troubles. Entrance is free to the public on any day when no event (such as a meeting of guilds, a noble's coming-of-age ball, or some such) is scheduled.</p><p>In the Year of Blue Fire (1385 DR), the Spellplague gripped the world. None knew it at the time, but it has since been divined that Cyric's long hatred for Mystra boiled over and led to his murder of the goddess of magic. I was absent from the world at this time—indisposed by the force of an <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZmI4MTFiZGI2MTM5 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>imprisonment</a></i> spell. Elminster has since explained the events to me, but I must confess that much of what he said made little sense. It was a long lecture having something to do with stars, “crystal spheres,” and “demiplanar reality mirrors.” Suffice it to say, parts of our world switched with parts of another one, and magic was again disrupted.</p><p>During this period, the powerful magical fields that protect and affect Waterdeep became unstable. This led to the disastrous activation of most of Waterdeep's amazing walking statues during an earthquake. In the years before, the walking statues were often hidden on the Ethereal Plane, to be called forth only in times of great peril. Many in the city doubted that such massive, sapient constructs were even real, let alone that they guarded the city invisibly. The Spellplague confirmed their existence for all to see, though, and each carved a swath of destruction through Waterdeep before it was stopped. Now the walking statues stand about the city in various states of readiness or disarray—one of the most obvious of Waterdeep's so-called splendors.</p><p>After the Spellplague came the Sundering. Elf scholars insist on calling it the Second Sundering, asserting that the creation of Evermeet thousands of years ago was a similar happening. Regardless of the name you give it, the event that unfolded beginning in 1482 DR was the result of another world—called Abeir, I am told—passing again into our own. The gods were once more cast into the mortal realm, this time embodied in mortal beings known as Chosen. The old troublemaker Ao seems to be the cause of it all, though why he chose to cast down the gods was a matter of dispute even among those entities while they were with us.</p><p>Apparently, all of this was foreseen by Waterdeep's legendary wizard Khelben Arunsun, and it was only through his wisdom and the efforts of Elminster, Laeral Silverhand—now the Open Lord of Waterdeep—and a handful of others that the world was saved. According to Elminster, Ao remade the <i>Tablets of Fate</i> as a result, restoring the divine order and separating Abeir from Toril. But take that as you may.

Characters who accept receive a silver pin of a harp within a crescent moon, along with their first mission (see the Harpers Missions table). Mirt also tells them that if they ever need to speak with him directly, they are welcome to visit his manor in the Sea Ward. If the characters do visit Mirt's manor, there's a 90 percent chance that Mirt isn't home and no one answers the door.</p><h4><b>Harper Missions</b></h4><table class=\"userscript-table userscript-table-bordered\"><thead><tr><th>Party Level</th><th>Mission Brief</th><th>Mission Requirements and Reward<br></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">2nd</td><td>“One of the drays working in the city is pulled by a talking mare named Maxeene.

Three years ago, they traded away the souls of their children to escape financial ruin. The soul of their eldest son, Osvaldo, was taken immediately. What was left behind was transformed into a chain devil, which the Cassalanters confined to their attic. Their two youngest children, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGFmN2YyNzhlODY0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Terenzio</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzA3Yzg1MTA3NDgy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Elzerina</a>, are doomed to lose their souls when they turn nine years old a mere ten days after Founders' Day, a midsummer festival that celebrates Waterdeep's founding.<br><br>After the deal was struck, the Cassalanters enjoyed a miraculous comeback. Their banking and money-lending business thrived while their competition suffered. The disappearance of their eldest son (and heir apparent) earned them sympathy. Their philanthropic endeavors bought them legitimacy and new friends. They became the envy of Waterdavian nobility in short order. Seemingly blessed, the Cassalanters attracted new followers to their cult of devil worship, which was Asmodeus's plan all along.<br><br>Reneging on a contract with Asmodeus is a luxury no mortal can afford, but there is a way for Lord and Lady Cassalanter to save the souls of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGFmN2YyNzhlODY0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Terenzio</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzA3Yzg1MTA3NDgy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Elzerina</a>. A clause in the contract allows them to preserve their remaining (and future) children's lives by instead paying “one shy of a million gold coins, and the sacrifice of one shy of one hundred unfortunate souls.” The Cassalanters have most of the coin they need, but they require the gold from the Vault of Dragons to buy their children's salvation without bankrupting themselves.<br><br>Victoro is in charge of locating the Vault of Dragons and securing the gold within it. Ammalia, for her part, plans to sacrifice ninety-nine souls in one fell swoop by throwing a feast on Founders' Day featuring poisoned food. Both the souls and the gold must be paid to Asmodeus at the same time. Foiling either one of these schemes spells doom for the Cassalanters' plot and their youngest children.<br><br><h2>Cult of Asmodeus</h2>Lord and Lady Cassalanter are the heads of a secretive cult of Asmodeus. The cult convenes at midnight once every tenday in the temple of Asmodeus beneath Cassalanter Villa. During rituals of worship, members of the cult, including Lord and Lady Cassalanter, wear crimson robes, golden masks, and golden sacrificial daggers. The masks and daggers are worth 75 gp each for the gold alone.<p></p><hr><p></p><h3>Meet the Cassalanters</h3>Each member of the Cassalanter family relaxes in different parts of the house and reacts separately to the discovery of characters intruding in their home. Lord and Lady Cassalanter are often out of the house on business, especially as Founders' Day draws near; they return home an hour before dinner.<br><br><h4>Lady Ammalia Cassalanter</h4>Lady Cassalanter reacts with surprise to the sight of uninvited guests, but quickly conceals her feelings with a welcoming smile. She attempts to gain the intruders' confidence by pretending to believe that they are guests of Victoro's and saying that she simply was not told of their presence. With this pretense established, she tries to learn the characters' true intentions, casting charm person on the party using a 5th-level spell slot (affecting up to five creatures within 30 feet) if necessary. Using magic in this way is illegal, but Ammalia has a lot of goodwill banked in Waterdeep—enough to curry favor with a magistrate.<br><br>During the hours when Ammalia is home and awake, her location in the villa can be determined randomly:<br><p></p><table class=\"userscript-table userscript-table-bordered\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align: center\">d100</th><th>Ammalia's Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">01-70</td><td>She's tending to her butterfly garden (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZjUyMmMwYjY3MWU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area C25</a>).</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">71-90</td><td>She's smoking on the balcony (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZjUyMmMwYjY3MWU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area C25a</a>).</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">91-00</td><td>She's weeping before Osvaldo in the attic (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZjUyMmMwYjY3MWU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area C24</a>).</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h4>Lord Victoro Cassalanter</h4><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjgxY2IxOTdjYWJj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Victoro Cassalanter</a> reacts with fiery rage to the sight of uninvited guests.

Any such character is visited by a white cat that speaks the following message in a melodious male voice:</p><blockquote><p>“Interested in joining the Emerald Enclave? Come meet us at Phaulkonmere in the Southern Ward.”</p></blockquote><p>The cat is an ordinary animal upon which an <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YTljMDI4NDc0ODQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>animal messenger</a></i> spell was cast. It dashes away after delivering its invitation.<br></p><h4>Melannor Fellbranch</h4><p>The characters' main contact in the Emerald Enclave is <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWZjNWFhNzQ0NjEz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Melannor</a> Fellbranch, the friendly but humorless groundskeeper of Phaulkonmere, a compound located one block south of Kolat Towers (see see the Winter Wizardry add-on). Phaulkonmere is owned by the Tarm and Phaulkon noble families. Melannor delivers missions by way of <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YTljMDI4NDc0ODQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>animal messenger</a></i> spells and is partial to using cats and pigeons as couriers. He quickly assigns new members their first mission.</p><p>Melannor is a half-elf <b>druid</b>, with these changes:</p><ul><li>Melannor is chaotic good.</li><li>He has these racial traits: He has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep. He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. He speaks Common and Elvish.</li></ul><h4>Jeryth Phaulkon</h4><p>When the characters arrive at Phaulkonmere for the first time, Melannor introduces them to the lady of the estate: a noblewoman-turned-demigod and Chosen of Mielikki named Jeryth Phaulkon. Jeryth, the only member of her family who currently resides at Phaulkonmere, manifests as a disembodied female voice that can be heard by anyone in the villa gardens. She offers membership in the enclave and bestows on each new member a charm of restoration (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDQ4NDI3NjQ0MTU5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Supernatural Gifts</a>” in from the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>). Jeryth also offers Phaulkonmere as a safe haven for enclave members and their friends.</p><p>In her disembodied state, Jeryth can't be harmed. If the need arises, Jeryth can cast any spell on the druid spell list. She uses her spells in defense of her estate and its beautiful gardens. A member of the Emerald Enclave can petition Jeryth to cast a spell, which she is happy to do if that character's renown in the enclave equals or exceeds the spell's level.</p><h4><b>Emerald Enclave Missions</b></h4><table class=\"userscript-table userscript-table-bordered\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align: center\">Party Level</th><th>Mission Brief</th><th>Mission Requirements and Reward<br></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">2nd</td><td>“Outlying farms are being terrorized by a scarecrow come to life.

The friendly dragon tries to coax as much treasure as it can from the characters. Those who converse with Zelifarn can make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check.

He commends the characters for making it this far and shows no concern for the Zhents they defeated to reach him, since he considers all his followers expendable. The characters' best chance of survival is to convince Manshoon that they can be cowed or bribed into working for him. Weary of his conflict with the Xanathar Guild, Manshoon suggests that the characters prove their usefulness to him by hunting down and killing Xanathar in its lair. Manshoon also demands that they keep his presence in Waterdeep a secret for now, saying that he will reward them for their discretion “when the time comes.” In exchange, he allows the characters to return to Waterdeep and promises them positions of power in his organization once Xanathar's death is confirmed. He has no intention of making good on this promise, but refusing to work for him puts the characters in a tight spot, since the evil archwizard can't risk exposure.<br><br>If a fight breaks out, Manshoon grabs his <i>staff of power</i> (which he hides under the bed) and holds his ground.

The construct attacks anyone other than Manshoon who disturbs the book (becoming visible as it does so). It obeys Manshoon's commands if he is present, and it fights until destroyed.<br></span><br><b><i>Table.</i></b> The table's drawer has an arcane lock spell cast on it. The spell can be bypassed by someone who makes a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or with a <i>knock</i> spell or similar magic. The drawer can also be forced open with a successful DC 21 Strength (Athletics) check. Inside is a leather-bound ledger that provides a paper trail implicating Manshoon in two blackmail schemes. An hour spent studying the ledger uncovers the following information:<br></p><ul><li style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\">Corylus Thann, a racist Waterdavian noble, is paying the Zhentarim not to reveal that he hired Zhent thugs to assault nonhumans.</li><li style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\">Jelenn Urmbrusk, a Waterdavian noble, receives regular payments from the Zhentarim to offset monies he loses in bad investments.</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The ledger doesn't reveal that Corylus Thann and Jelenn Urmbrusk are Masked Lords, or that Manshoon's blackmail of them also forces them to use their influence to cover up or dismiss crimes perpetrated by Manshoon's forces in Waterdeep. If the authorities obtain the ledger, they round up anyone suspected of having ties to Manshoon or the Zhentarim, which disrupts the wizard's operation (see Disrupting Manshoon's Operation). Surprisingly, neither Corylus nor Jelenn is arrested or even questioned.<br></span><br>Slipped into the ledger is a piece of paper with a list of names in Manshoon's handwriting.

If they try to speak with him, they are met by the clerk at the front desk, who informs them that they must schedule a meeting with the magister first, because visitors need her written permission to see him. The clerk says the meeting with the magister can happen no sooner than highsun on the following day but can be persuaded to move up the time for a bribe of 10 gp or more.</p><p>There are alternatives to speaking with the magister, if the characters have sufficient renown in a politically influential faction—or a talent for deception:</p><ul><li>A character who has at least 4 renown in the Harpers can convince <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWJlODY4YWM1OGRk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Mirt</a></b>&nbsp;to use his authority as a Lord of Waterdeep to secure Fenerus's release. Mirt has personally lost coin to the Blood Hawk Posse, so helping Fenerus squirm out of jail stings him deeply.</li><li>A character who has at least 4 renown in the Lords' Alliance can arrange a meeting with <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWM1M2NkZmE0YmI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Laeral Silverhand</a></b> at Piergeiron's Palace and convince her to give Fenerus what he wants in exchange for information on the stone's whereabouts. The safe return of Neverember's cache of dragons is more important to her than the fate of one brigand.</li><li>The characters can purposely get themselves arrested in the Castle Ward. Even a minor crime can result in a brief period of incarceration until the magister has time to render judgment. In the meantime, characters can try to speak to Fenerus.</li><li>The characters can try to infiltrate the courthouse using mundane disguises or magic. Impersonating an official or using magic to influence one is a crime (see the Code Legal handout in appendix C), so they must be stealthy or skilled at deception.</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>Meeting with the Magister</h4><p>The courthouse magister is Hester Barch (LG female Turami human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODM0ZGYwOTU1MjRh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>acolyte</a></b> with Insight +4), a petite woman in her seventies. Magister Barch is slow to anger and fond of sharing lengthy educational anecdotes and parables. Unknown to all but her closest aides, the magister has the innate psionic ability to cast the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZjdjNDZmZjBjOGU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect thoughts</a></i> spell without somatic or material components. After using it once, the magister must finish a short or long rest before she can cast the spell again. Wisdom is her spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12).</p><p>The magister is disinclined to agree to any request for a private meeting with Fenerus, on the grounds that he's a shady, unrepentant person and a flight risk. The conditions under which she will permit a meeting are as follows:</p><ul><li>A character who has at least 3 renown in the Harpers or the Lords' Alliance, or a character who belongs to a Waterdavian noble family, makes a good argument and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.</li><li>A character who is impersonating a noble or an official makes a good argument and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check. If the check fails, Magister Barch sees through the ruse and uses her <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZjdjNDZmZjBjOGU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect thoughts</a></i> spell to verify that the character is in fact disguised as a noble or an official—a crime that carries a punishment of flogging followed by imprisonment for up to a tenday, plus a fine of up to 500 gp.</li><li>A character tells the magister about the hidden cache of dragons and Fenerus's role in finding it.</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>Talking to Fenerus</h4><p>Fenerus Stormcastle (N male Tethyrian <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjE2MDM2ZDZlOGQz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bandit captain</a></b>) is confined to a cell in area H8, waiting to stand trial. He is charged with multiple counts of theft (highway banditry) and assaults against Waterdavian citizens. Fenerus knew it was only a matter of time until someone tipped off the City Watch; he suspects that another member of the Blood Hawk Posse gave him up. The timing is unfortunate for him, since he was planning to earn a small fortune by turning over the <i>Stone of Go­lorr</i> to his Luskanite contact. Now, he plans to use the stone to escape imprisonment and wipe his criminal record clean.</p><p>If the characters can get close enough to speak with him, Fenerus refuses to divulge the stone's location until he is released and granted immunity for his past crimes. He knows that the presiding magister or a Lord of Waterdeep has the authority to give him what he wants.</p><p>The only condition under which Magister Barch will consider acquiescing to Fenerus's demands is if the characters convince her that such a decision is good for Waterdeep. To accomplish that, they either must use magic to beguile her (which is a crime and likely to result in the caster's arrest once the effect wears off), or they must tell her about the Vault of Dragons and the stolen gold. In either case, she insists on trying something before letting him off the hook: after taking a short rest, she has Fenerus brought to her courtroom and questions him about the stone. Surreptitiously, she uses her <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZjdjNDZmZjBjOGU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect thoughts</a></i> spell to scan his surface thoughts in an attempt to discern the stone's location. Given that the stone is foremost in Fenerus's mind, Magistrate Barch learns where it is hidden, shares the information with the characters, and returns Fenerus to his cell.</p><p><br></p><h4>Where's the Stone?</h4><p>Fenerus hid the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> on the top floor of an old tower in the Dock Ward—a tower warded against all forms of magic. If he is freed, he offers to lead the characters to the tower or provides directions so they can find it on his own.</p><p><br></p><h4>Next Encounter</h4><p>If the characters learn where Fenerus hid the stone and go after it, proceed with encounter 7, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDI2MWRmNGNjMWE2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Old Tower</a>.”</p></section>","img":""}

All that remains is for the characters to collect their reward.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Rewards</span></h3><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWM5N2VjMGZkZWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Volo</a> is drinking alone in the Yawning Portal while anxiously awaiting news of Floon's fate. He springs up and runs to embrace the characters and his friend as soon as he sees them.</p><h4>A Good Deed</h4><p>If the characters reunite Volo with Floon, Volo gives them a rather sheepish look as he explains their reward:</p><blockquote><p>“I confess that I have but few coins to spare. But never let it be said that Volo reneges on a promise. Allow me to present something much more valuable.” He holds out a scroll tube. “The deed to a remarkable property here in Waterdeep! We'll need a magistrate to witness the transfer of ownership. I'll arrange a meeting with one after you've inspected the estate and deemed it satisfactory.”</p></blockquote><p>The tube contains a deed to Trollskull Manor, a historic building in the North Ward that the characters can claim as a home base. The deed has been notarized and appears legitimate (because it is). Volo recently bought the property because it is rumored to be haunted, and he was hoping that investigating it might yield a chapter for his next book, <i>Volo's Guide to Spirits and Specters</i>.<br></p><p>If the characters accept their reward, Volo sets up a meeting with a tiefling magistrate named Kylynne Silmerhelve. The brief session takes place at a courthouse in the Castle Ward at highsun. Magistrate Silmerhelve witnesses the transfer of the deed, rendering the new ownership official, with the impatience of one who has more important matters to attend to. She also collects an estate transfer tax of 25 gp, which is normally paid by the new owners. If the characters can't afford this fee or don't want to pay it and they have befriended <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjVkOTBiZjc2MjEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Renaer Neverember</a>, he makes sure that Volo has a pouch of coins to cover the expense.</p><h4>Fine Friends</h4><p>Volo, Floon, and Renaer all express their gratitude through camaraderie. If the characters need to call upon their new friends for an occasional favor, any of them are happy to oblige. Floon has little to offer the characters, but friendship with Volo and Renaer has its perks.</p><p>Volo knows the best places to eat and find merriment. He can also give characters a tour of Waterdeep. If the characters accept his offer, share the information in “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZjkxZmZjODdlYmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion</a>” with the players.</p><p>Although Renaer is estranged from his rich and powerful father, he still has friends in high places, including Harpers who can come to the characters' rescue if they need it. If the characters are looking for an audience with influential persons in Waterdeep, Renaer can set up meetings with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWJlODY4YWM1OGRk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Mirt</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTE4YzIzZTdhMmQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Remallia Haventree</a>, or just about any other Waterdavian noble, if he thinks the characters will comport themselves well.</p><hr><h2><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 24px ; font-weight: bold\">Level Advancement</span></h2><p>If you're using milestone level advancement instead of tracking experience points, the characters advance from 1st to 2nd level when they return to Volo after having explored the Xanathar Guild hideout.</p></section>","img":""}

The Thann and Umbrusk families have walled estates in the Sea Ward.</span></p><p><br></p><h4 style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Corylus Thann</span></h4><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The Thanns are Waterdeep's most prominent vintners and have deep roots in the city. Corylus (LE male Tethyrian human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmJiZDQxMDE4MGUw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>noble</a></b>) is happy to let other members of his family manage the wine business while he focuses on his duties as a Masked Lord. Unfortunately, he lacks the principles and sound judgment that have led to House Thann's success in the past. He also places the welfare of humans above nonhumans. In the past, he has used Zhentarim thugs to inflict harm on nonhumans who sought positions of political power in the city. Now the Zhents are blackmailing Corylus, threatening to expose his bigotry unless he uses his influence as a Masked Lord to cover up their illegal activities.<br></span><br>The characters are most likely to encounter Corylus as he travels through the city by coach, accompanied by six human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDJkNmQ0MmYxODgw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a></b> who watch his back and keep the rabble at bay. Corylus refuses to speak with the party. If the characters become an annoyance, he has eight crooked members of the City Watch (human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veterans</a></b>) crack down on them, then uses his position as Masked Lord to clear any charges leveled against these Watch members. Corylus refuses to be indebted to anyone, so any attempt by the characters to curry favor with him is met with suspicion, if not outright hostility. Even if they dispose of Manshoon, Corylus refuses to acknowledge that he owes them anything.<br><br></p><h4>Jelenn Urmbrusk</h4>Jelenn (N female Tethyrian human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmJiZDQxMDE4MGUw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>noble</a></b>) is a proud woman in her fifties who desperately wants to get out of debt. Several bad investments ruined her money-lending business, and most of her reliable customers have turned to other providers such as the Cassalanters. Jelenn could have borrowed money from any of a number of nobles in the city or sold off some of the property her family owns in Waterdeep, but doing so would have turned her private financial woes into local gossip. Fear of that exposure led her to borrow money from the Zhentarim instead—a decision she has come to regret. The Zhents working for Manshoon promise to keep their relationship secret on the condition that she do everything in her power to further the group's welfare in Waterdeep.<br><br>When not dealing with her slimy creditors, Jelenn is occupied with Masked Lord business. She has no time for a face-to-face meeting with anyone she doesn't know. Characters can confront her as she comes or goes to and from her villa, but she never travels without sixteen guards who form a protective wall around her. If the characters brazenly mention Manshoon or the Zhentarim by name to her, Jelenn demands that they leave her alone or face dire consequences. Jelenn's threat is mostly bluster, since she's not eager to make enemies.<br><br>If the characters free Jelenn from the yoke of the Black Network by defeating Manshoon, her debt is effectively canceled. In her delight, she grants them a special favor (see <b>Special Favors</b>). On the other hand, if they threaten to go to the press with Manshoon's ledger in an attempt to blackmail or discredit her, she pretends to go along with them while secretly using her influence as a Masked Lord to make their lives difficult.<p></p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"></p><h3>Deadwinter Day Feast</h3>The Fellowship of Innkeepers—in conjunction with the Bakers' Guild, the Guild of Butchers, and the Vintners', Distillers', and Brewers' Guild—decides to hold a Deadwinter Day feast for the residents of Trollskull Alley. Broxley Fairkettle (see <u>Sample Guild Representatives</u> in <b>Open For Business?</b>) asks the characters if they would be willing to host the feast in their tavern. He believes the gesture would be appreciated by their neighbors, in light of the recent deaths in the area.<br><br>If the characters offer up their tavern for the feast, guild representatives arrive to stock and decorate it for the event. During the three days before the holiday, the tavern is bustling with activity and excitement. Hundreds show up on the day of the feast to partake—not only residents of Trollskull Alley, but also folk from neighboring streets. There's plenty of food to go around, but the tavern practically groans under the weight of the crowd, and additional tables are set up outside to handle the overflow. People don't appear to mind, even as heavy snow begins to fall. Members of the City Watch are on hand to make sure everyone behaves.<br><br>Nothing violent happens during the Deadwinter Day feast, but the tavern suffers damage as a result of the crowds. The Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild offers to make repairs for free, but the characters must close the establishment for a tenday to facilitate the work. The closure has no effect on business in the long term, however, since the feast fosters such goodwill that clients return in force when the tavern reopens.<br><br>The feast is a great opportunity for characters to hobnob with neighbors, guild members, and City Watch constables, as well as to gather information on local happenings.<p></p><hr><h3 style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\">Secret Simulacrum</h3><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">If the characters make an enemy of Manshoon, he tries to capture one of them and replace that character with a magical duplicate created using the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YTBmY2U4MjY3MjZm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>simulacrum</a></i> spell. If one of the players is absent for a game session and circumstances allow it, Manshoon targets that character for replacement while the rest of the party is distracted by other matters. You don't need to roleplay the character's capture; just assume it happens. To create a simulacrum of the character, Manshoon needs some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of the character's body. Once he obtains the necessary components from the captured character, he creates the simulacrum and sends it to the party with instructions to spy on the group and undermine it from within.<br></span><br>If Manshoon embeds a simulacrum within the party, talk privately to the player whose character has been replaced. Then have that player run the simulacrum until it is destroyed or the character it replaced is reintroduced. The simulacrum has the same statistics as the character, but it has only half the character's hit point maximum and can't gain levels.</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/012_-_Dragon_Heist_3A_Winter_Adventure/001_-_Chapter_8_3A_Winter_Wizardry/004_-_Special_Events/avatar.png"}

Yet civilized doesn't mean safe, nor does it mean easy to navigate. Many day-to-day elements of life in Waterdeep that residents take for granted are, to new arrivals, a bevy of wonders and dangers not seen in any other settlement within a thousand miles. Here's what you need to know to survive your first few hours in the city. Mark this section for frequent reference!</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">The Code Legal</span></h3><p>Waterdeep is no village led by hidebound hierarchs or petty fiefdom ruled by the whim of a warlord. It is a city of laws molded by Tyr's spirit of justice. As a rule, you can trust members of the City Watch to do their duty diligently, and you can expect that the city's magisters will be fair. If you have cause to come before the Masked Lords or the Open Lord herself, rest assured that if your cause be just, justice will be done. If, however, you find yourself in the wrong, know that though it might take time to weigh that wrong on Tyr's scales, his hammer will fall—and it will be wielded by Waterdeep with a vengeance.</p><p>Unlike in less civilized settlements, punishment for crimes in Waterdeep isn't typically used as public entertainment. Scheduled executions occur behind the high walls of Castle Waterdeep, and floggings are carried out in the watch post nearest the sentencing. The Watch makes every effort to take individuals into custody quietly, so as not to disrupt other citizens. Those bystanders generally return the favor by giving altercations between criminals and the Watch a wide berth.</p><p>Waterdeep has a complex library of law and custom set by precedent, the main body of which can be read in the Code Legal. This document is available in multiple languages at the Palace of Waterdeep, and (in the Common tongue) provided on request by the magisters at the gates and in the harbor. Be aware that the Code Legal provides only an outline of typical sentences for various offenses, and magisters have broad discretion when meting out justice as they see fit. Any Masked Lord can overturn a magister's ruling, but there's rarely a Masked Lord around when you need one.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Arms, Armor, and Combat</span></h3><p>Individuals accustomed to the rough-and-tumble life in much of the North are often surprised by the fact that Waterdavians go about unarmed and unarmored. Yet Waterdeep doesn't have any law that forbids carrying weapons or armor. Instead, it has a culture of civility that makes such behavior unnecessary.</p><p>Dueling has long been illegal in Waterdeep, as has any sort of act involving assault. Individuals caught brawling by the Watch will all be arrested and judged regardless of who started the fracas, or why. (The tavern brawls that typically break out under the influence of too much drink will often be overlooked by the Watch, as long as the proprietor doesn't seek payment for damages and no one is significantly injured.) Sport fighting, such as boxing or wrestling, is legal only if it occurs in a location registered with the city for that purpose. Additionally, any blade more than one foot in length is subject to an extra tax whenever it is sold, which helps to explain why Waterdavians prefer to carry knives and knuckledusters for self-defense.</p><p>Businesses and individuals do employ armed guards, but except for nobles or foreign envoys, few people travel about the city with such protection. As such, the sight of armed and armored individuals walking the streets who aren't in the livery of the city or one of its noble houses inspires caution in most Waterdavians. Folk assume that you wouldn't bother lugging around such equipment unless you either intend violence or expect that it might soon be visited upon you.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">City Watch</span></h3><p>The first soldiers you see in service to the city will be the members of the City Guard who patrol the roads leading to Waterdeep, watch the walls, guard civic structures, and protect magisters. Waterdeep's streets, however, are policed by an altogether different force: the City Watch. The similarity of their names often confuses newcomers, so I offer this handy mnemonic: “The Guard guards the walls while the Watch watches all.”</p><p>You can recognize any member of the City Watch by the uniform: a green-and-goldenrod doublet and a tall steel helmet. Each typically carries a long truncheon, a dagger, and a buckler. Because most citizens in Waterdeep don't bear weapons, these tools prove a more than ample deterrent to criminal activity. Members of the Watch typically don't carry crossbows or other weapons to attack at range, but running from the Watch—though it may be a time-honored tradition for local miscreants—rarely works out for newcomers to the city. I guarantee that all members of the Watch know the streets they patrol and that area's residents better than you do, even if you stay in Waterdeep for ten seasons.</p><p>The City Watch has watch posts throughout the city. These stations are often off the main thoroughfares, tucked away in small courtyards or at cross streets. A watch post can be recognized by the green-and-gold lantern outside it, lit even during the day with a <i>continual flame</i> spell. A watch post serves as an organizational headquarters and armory. Anyone who wishes to report a crime may do so at a watch post in the event a Watch constable can't be found elsewhere. A watch post typically contains a few holding cells where people arrested for crimes can be detained until they're marched to a courthouse jail before standing trial.</p><p>Small squads head out from the watch posts on daily and nightly rounds of the city streets, or on special assignments involving protection or investigation. A mere pair of Watch operatives might discreetly patrol in the Castle Ward; in contrast, squads of eight walk the Dock Ward, increasing to as many as a dozen at night. If Watch members spot trouble they can't handle, they blow shrill tin whistles to summon more of their members—an act that alerts nearby citizens as well.</p><p>City Watch members follow a strict code of conduct that makes them one of the most trusted police forces aside from paladin-patrolled Elturgard. As long as you don't engage in unlawful behavior, you can expect to be left untroubled by the Watch.</p><p><b style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px\">Watch Talk</b><br></p>Members of the City Watch employ a sort of slang in dealing with the public. As a visitor, it behooves you to know what they mean.<p></p><p>“What befalls?” means “Someone tell me what's going on here.”<br>“Hold!” means “Don't move a muscle.”<br>“Down arms!” means “Drop your weapons.”<br>“Talk truth!” means “Answer me” or “Tell the whole story.”<br>“Robes” references the black robes—in other words, one of the magisters. “Do we need robes here?” or something similar should be taken as a threat.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">The Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors</span></h3><p>Expect to be questioned at the gate, or when you register with a magister, regarding your ability to cast arcane magic. Wizards, sorcerers, and other arcane spellcasters who intend to stay in Waterdeep for any length of time are required to register with the city, and will be strongly encouraged to join the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, headed by the Blackstaff.</p><p>Members of the Watchful Order are expected to render service to the city when called upon, acting as temporary members of the City Watch or City Guard. Their expertise often helps investigators determine whether magic was used to commit a crime in the city. Members can also expect to be tapped for assistance during and after fires, natural events that cause multiple casualties, or other nonmagical disasters.</p><p>Members of the Watchful Order form a more or less sociable association in the city, working together to keep an eye on any spellcasters who opt not to join their guild. Any havoc caused by a spellcaster in Waterdeep risks drawing the wrath of the Lords of Waterdeep—so it behooves the Watchful Order to watch all its members.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Coinage</span></h3><p>As should be expected of any city of standing, Waterdeep mints its own coins. All taxes, fines, and guild fees must be paid either in Waterdavian coin or the currency of any member settlement of the Lords' Alliance. Though no law requires you to pay for goods or services in Waterdavian coin, the drudgery of weighing foreign currency and checking its purity prompts many retailers and operators of swift-exchange businesses—including drays and hire-coaches—not to accept anything but coins minted in Waterdeep.</p><p>Though you can trade your coinage for Waterdeep currency with anyone willing to do so, the exchequers at the Palace of Waterdeep make exchanges with no associated fee. The queue there can be quite long, necessitating that you make an appointment—often a day or more in advance. For a swifter transaction, I recommend any member of the Guild of Trusted Pewterers and Casters, or of the Jewelers' Guild. Both have the most reliable scales and abide by guild-wide rates of exchange.</p><p>Be sure to exchange taols and harbor moons before leaving the city, as their value greatly diminishes elsewhere!</p><h4>COINS OF WATERDEEP</h4><p>Here are images of the city's coins, which aren't to scale.</p><p></p><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit\"><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzhhMjAxYzgxNGYx  style=\"font-size: 12px ; font-weight: bold\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>NIB</a></span></h4>Copper coin about the size of a thumbnail<br>(1 nib = 1 common copper coin)<p></p><h4><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDkzMTc1MDk1Yjlh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>SHARD</a></h4><p>Silver coin, slightly smaller than the nib<br>(1 shard = 10 nibs)</p><h4><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDcyNGQwYzhhZmFh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>TAOL</a>&nbsp;(<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTNmMWVhMWJjMWM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>alternate image</a>)</h4><p>Brass coin, about two inches square with a hole large enough for a nib to fit in <br>(1 taol = 200 nibs)</p><h5><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmI1Y2RlNDJiYzFh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>DRAGON</a></h5><p>Gold coin, half again as large as a nib<br>(1 dragon = 100 nibs)</p><h5><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NGVlMWU5N2U2YTUw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>SUN</a></h5><p>Platinum coin, twice as large as a nib<br>(1 sun = 1,000 nibs)</p><h5><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDAzYjI5MzhhZGIz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>HARBOR MOON</a></h5><p>platinum crescent inset with electrum, about three inches long with a hole large enough for a nib to fit in<br>(1 harbor moon = 5,000 nibs)</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Taxes and Fees</span></h3><p>As established in the first year of the reign of the previous Open Lord, Dagult Neverember, Waterdeep collects a monthly tax from all who live within its official wards. The tax is 1 shard per person above the age of ten years, and is collected door-to-door by patrols of the City Guard on the last day of each month.</p><p>Individuals who so desire can pay a single dragon in tax and receive a writ exempting them for twelve months, but the writ must be produced every month when the Guard calls, or a new payment is required. If the Guard knocks at a door and receives no answer, a notice of lien with an estimation of tax is affixed to the door. The debt must be dealt with before the next month ends, with payment to be made to any magister.</p><p>Those who have no fixed residence can still be taxed if they are confronted in any building, be it an inn or an outhouse. So if you're out and around on the last day of the month, you'll no doubt experience “taxing traffic” as the streets become clogged with people trying to avoid the collectors.</p><p>Waterdeep also raises revenue by charging other fees, such as the following:</p><ul><li><b>1 nib</b> per day for rental of a stall in the Market</li><li><b>1 shard</b> (above and beyond any fines imposed) from anyone convicted by a magister, per conviction</li><li><b>1 dragon</b> per conveyance leaving the city, empty or full</li><li><b>5 dragons</b> per ship that touches dock in Waterdeep (except for city ships and diplomatic vessels), collected from the captain and covering a stay of up to fourteen days (a ship that leaves the harbor and returns during that time pays the tax upon reentry)</li></ul><p>In times of trouble, direct taxes can also be imposed:</p><ul><li>A <b>fire tax</b> (usually 1 dragon per household), levied whenever a fire destroys a large portion of the city</li><li>A <b>wall tax </b>or harbor tax (usually 1 dragon per household) raised to directly pay for needed repairs or expansions</li><li>A <b>lance tax</b> raised to provide a payroll for mercenaries hired by the city when required (usually 1 shard per household each tenday until the Lords repeal the tax)</li></ul><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Getting About</span></h3><p>Perambulating is the superior manner of experiencing the city and all its splendors. But if you've come with your own conveyance, the weather is inclement, or some other reason drives you to use the roads, the following are facts you need to know.</p><h4>Traffic and Travel</h4><p>Waterdeep is a city of broad boulevards that thrum with traffic. All day and well into the night, a bewildering melee of wagons, carts, horse and pony riders, carriages, buggies, hire-coaches, and Waterdeep's signature towering drays (further discussed below) surges through its major thoroughfares. Fortunately, most roads are flanked by paved sidewalks that give pedestrians plenty of space, and most of the widest roads have raised dividers that allow an individual crossing a street a safe space to step out of the fray and wait for traffic to pass.</p><p>The city's centuries-old layout dictates its traffic patterns today. Waterdeep lies on a plateau adjacent to a long mountain that shields much of it from the sea. In the southern third of the city, where the land slopes up from the harbor, the High Road and the Way of the Dragon are the two main south–north roads. These converge both at the Waymoot near the southern gate, and in the heart of the Trades Ward where the city is at its narrowest—bounded by Castle Waterdeep, high on a spur of the mountain, and the walls of the City of the Dead. The conjoined boulevard then splits to the north, continuing as the High Road, and to the west as a boulevard called Waterdeep Way, heading toward the Palace of Waterdeep (not to be confused with Waterdeep Castle, which it passes hard by). In the middle of the city, six boulevards run north from Waterdeep Way, where they meet the road that encircles the Market. On the other side of the Market, five boulevards continue north.</p><p>The aforementioned boulevards, along with the Street of the Singing Dolphin in the Sea Ward, are the major arteries of the city. Hire-coaches and drays can be most frequently found on those streets, and traffic is at its most hectic there. Most other roads in the city run east to west, but regardless of their direction, traffic elsewhere is generally less hectic and thus safer to cross.</p><h4>Street Signs</h4><p>Thanks to the Scriveners', Scribes', and Clerks' Guild, Waterdeep has a remarkable custom of labeling its streets, and even many of its alleyways and courts. The method of identification varies by ward and neighborhood (including brass plates, carvings in stone, and stencil-painted wooden signs), but street names are typically displayed on the corners of buildings at intersections, roughly a dozen feet above ground. The name of the road you travel on will be on the wall nearest, while the name of the crossing road will be around the corner. Simply ingenious!</p><h4>Landmarks</h4><p>Proud Mount Waterdeep provides a useful landmark for general orientation. It stands stark across the skyline to the west, its far slopes dropping right into the sea. A spur of the mountain juts inland, and atop the easternmost point of this spur stands Castle Waterdeep. If you can see these landmarks, it's relatively easy to orient yourself. The mountain peak looms over the southern third of the city near the port in the south. The City of the Dead lies opposite the northern ridge of Mount Waterdeep, which descends down to the Field of Triumph, the city's great coliseum.</p><p>One of Waterdeep's titanic walking statues, no longer mobile, offers another way to orient yourself on a local scale. At nine stories tall, twice the height of any buildings nearby, the Honorable Knight stands guard in a block of buildings between Snail Street and the Way of the Dragon. Positioned as it is nigh the place where four wards meet, you can use it to judge where you stand. If it is south and west of your position, you are in the Trades Ward. North and west? The Southern Ward. South and east? The Castle Ward. North and east? You're in the Dock Ward.</p><h4>Traffic Wardens</h4><p>During particularly heavy traffic and at congested areas such as the great oval road around the Market, you might see a member of the City Watch serving as a traffic warden. Traffic wardens signal with small blue hand flags for traffic to proceed, and with yellow flags for traffic to hold. A traffic warden can often be heard blowing a whistle. When you hear it, look to the warden to see if you are being signaled. Failure to take care might result not only in accident but also arrest.</p><h4>Drays</h4><p>These towering vehicles are, I believe, unique to Waterdeep. Invented by exiles from Lantan in the last century, a dray is a long, glassed-in carriage with bench seating that provides additional open-air bench seating on its roof. The driver sits at the level of the roof seating, providing a vantage point to see over other traffic and make eye contact with other dray drivers. You can enter this contraption through the back whenever it stops or slows down enough to make mounting the rear step safe.</p><p>A fare taker stands at the back of the lower seating area to take your coin (typically 2 to 4 nibs). You can choose to ride inside or ascend the spiral stairway at the rear to ride atop the vehicle. Most drays run on the main north–south boulevards, but some circle the Market, and a few run along the smaller east–west roads in rough areas. Be warned that when the demand for drays is high—during rain or snow, or to get to or from an event at the Field of Triumph—conditions become crowded and perfect for pickpockets.</p><h4>Hire-Coaches</h4><p>If you desire to travel in relative comfort and be the master of your destination, simply give a spirited wave and shout to any hire-coach driver who has no passengers. Each of these handsome, two-wheeled black coaches comfortably seats two travelers (perhaps four if you're quite slim and very well acquainted), who ride facing the road ahead. The hire-coach's driver sits high and to the rear of the carriage, manipulating the horses by means of long reins and a short whip on a rod. The fare must be agreed upon and paid before the journey, but only rarely will the cost exceed a half-dozen shards.</p><h4>Carriages</h4><p>The well-to-do—or those who want to ride in luxury during a day out—can hire a full carriage, many of which are as finely outfitted as those owned by the nobility. Up to eight can take such a ride in silken comfort. Prices and services vary, but generally you agree to rent the carriage, the services of the driver, and any attendant servants or guards for a full day.</p><h4>Travel in Winter</h4><p>The folk of Waterdeep often remain indoors in the colder months, particularly when it rains or snows. The flow of trade and travelers into the city slows to a trickle during winter, and as a result, traffic diminishes and drays and hire-coaches become more scarce. Fortunately, the Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen works with the Wheelwrights' Guild and the Wagon-makers' and Coach Builders' Guild to convert the drays and hire-coaches that do operate into sledges, so that some are available even in the worst weather.</p><p><b>The Unflappable Waterdavian</b><br>Natives of the City of Splendors are notoriously slow to take offense. A Waterdavian plainly states their feelings as a warning, so that one is apt to hear “I don't find that amusing, friend,” said pleasantly before real anger is shown. Some visitors misinterpret such behavior as cowardice or ignorance (“He was too stupid to realize I insulted him!”). For those who act on such misjudgments, however, surprise and regret are the usual results.</p><p>Most Waterdavians are also slow to take fright unless facing magic or monsters. A swaggering warrior threatening them is quite likely to be stared at calmly, or even sneered at. “The only mortals that Waterdavians fear are a few unstable wizards and the Lords,” Durnan often says to those who are surprised by the nonchalance of the Yawning Portal's regulars concerning the open entrance to Undermountain in their midst. “And only when they've incurred the wrath of said persons themselves.”</p><p><b>A Wondrous People<br></b>Whenever you find yourself in a bustling city, you're likely to spot a wonderful variety of folk. You hear words in languages utterly foreign to you, and you smell dishes both delectable and strange. Waterdeep is the ultimate city of such delights, and before long, the alien thing becomes familiar to you, and the stranger becomes your friend.</p><p>The people of Waterdeep are among the greatest of its splendors. Fashion, comportment, love—these things are practiced with an art and a zest in the city uncommon elsewhere. Visit a festhall or festival and see for yourself! And don't miss the cross-dressing performers who regale audiences with humor and song. Fabulous—that word doesn't begin to describe it, especially when they enhance the merriment with magic.</p><p>The city is also a haven for those who define for themselves what it means to be a man or a woman, those who transcend gender as the gods do, and those who redefine entirely who they are. What confidence! I never tire of witnessing it. I have seen folk in Waterdeep whose lives are more magical than the marvels possible with spells.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Nobility</span></h3><p>While you might encounter dwarf diplomats from Gauntlgrym, satraps of Amn, duchesses of Tethyr, or thanes of the Northlanders in Waterdeep, the nobles you really need to know about are the city's own. Seventy-eight noble family lines are found here, many of which can trace their lineage back to the city's founding. Books have been written about individual families—histories of their accomplishments and how they fit into the webs of wealth and patronage that govern nobles' activities—so it is beyond the scope of a pamphlet this size to attempt to describe their particulars. I can, however, endeavor to equip you with the tools to recognize nobility and to interact with the higher class.</p><h4>Spotting a Noble</h4><p>Nobility in Waterdeep are granted the right to bear arms. In the legal code of the city, this means not merely the ability to carry a weapon, but the right to retain up to seventy equipped soldiers. These soldiers always wear a house's colors and the house's “arms of grace”—a heraldic device often borne on a shield, worn as a cloak pin, or affixed to a helmet. Others throughout the city, even foreign dignitaries, are permitted to retain only up to sixteen armed warriors, and laws against impersonating those in the employ of the nobility mean that other mercenaries and bodyguards most often dress plainly, so as not to be mistaken for the retinue of a noble. So your first clue that you might be in the company of a noble is the sight of a large number of armed and uniformed soldiers.</p><p>Many nobles, particularly younger ones seeking entertainment, travel without an entourage of guards or only in the company of other nobles. In this case, you'll know you're in the presence of nobility because of the deference others give them. Follow suit, and you should be fine.</p><p>Above all, be polite. Always address a known noble as “Lord” or “Lady.” A short bow or a nod of the head to acknowledge a noble upon each meeting and parting is customary. Obsequiousness and servility is something all Waterdavians scorn, but you should also beware of acting in an overly familiar, boastful, or disrespectful way when in the presence of any noble. Though this sort of behavior isn't a crime, and laws against dueling prevent a noble from initiating a direct armed confrontation, the noble families of Waterdeep have immense power in the city, often in unexpected quarters. Many have influence in nations as distant as Calimshan and Cormyr. Be assured that any slighting of a noble will not be forgotten or easily forgiven.</p><p>If you're not certain whether someone is a noble, address the gentleman as “Saer” or the gentlewoman as “Goodwoman.” Neither will give offense, and generally a noble will politely correct you as to their actual title.</p><h4>Nobles and Patronage</h4><p>Nobles in Waterdeep are patrons of and investors in all manner of businesses in the city and abroad, as well as the many expressions of the arts. They spend coin to fund celebrations, contests at the Field of Triumph, upkeep at the city's temples and shrines, civic projects, guild events, and charitable actions such as burial of the unknown dead. Their motives are manifold, but their actions—no matter the reason—earn them loyalty and high regard from those who benefit from their largesse.</p><p>Seeking patronage from a noble without having been introduced to that person is considered an insult, so you must first befriend someone in a noble's employ or circle of influence. Doing so is no guarantee of ultimate success; much time and coin can be wasted trying to curry favor with an acquaintance of a noble who turns out to be unscrupulous or of little help for some other reason. My advice is to do something deserving of attention, whatever your vocation, and someone from the noble families of Waterdeep will eventually show an interest.</p><h4>Know a Noble's Business</h4><p>In the words of that quarrelsome acquaintance of mine from the Dales, “Before you strut your stuff in the chickens' preening circle, get to know the other cocks first.” This colorful aphorism applies well to the affairs of nobility, because when you have interaction with a noble, you are at the same time dealing with one's entire family—as well as a network of business associates and allies. That situation can put you in a troublesome spot if you are unaware of the noble's connections.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Guilds and Guild Law</span></h3><p>No aspect of life in Waterdeep goes untouched by at least one of its more than forty guilds. Virtually every profession has an associated guild, and there's hardly a citizen of the city who doesn't belong to one or more guilds, or doesn't work for someone who does. As a visitor to Waterdeep, you need to know this, lest you run afoul of “Guild Law.” Guild Law isn't technically in the legal code of Waterdeep, but guilds are mentioned in the oldest surviving legal documents—penned by Ahghairon himself—and the rules of Guild Law are respected by wise city folk.</p><p>Guilds take their laws seriously, as do members of the City Watch and the magisters. If you flout a guild's traditions, you can expect not only public scorn but also a visit from enforcers of the law. In addition, many guilds have their own codes of accusation, trial, and punishment, such as:</p><ul><li>A member of the Bakers' Guild who sells bread baked in the wrong shape will be drenched with water and coated in his own flour.</li><li>Heckling a member of the Jesters' Guild will result in the offending party being jeered at in public by no less than four guild members for a period of four days.</li><li>Any ship that unloads its cargo without due observance or aid by the Guild of Watermen shall have its cargo seized or thrown into the harbor.</li></ul><p>Many guilds have codes that entwine each other, complicating matters even more for the outsider. In Neverwinter, if you want to construct a building, you simply purchase the land and hire workers to build it. In Waterdeep, the Surveyors', Map-, and Chart-makers' Guild must first be consulted upon designation of the plat, then brought in to draw or approve the construction plan. The Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild must then clear and prepare the site, only after which will you be able to hire members of the Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild to erect the structure.</p><p>Moreover, the work will not be complete until members of the Guild of Fine Carvers and the Guild of Stonecutters, Masons, Potters, and Tile-makers design and craft any decorative elements of wood, stone, or ceramics, and after the Most Careful Order of Skilled Smiths and Metalforgers has manufactured and installed any door hinges. If the building is to be connected to the sewers or a city water supply, the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild must be called upon again to do that work. Want glazed windows installed? For that, you need to hire members of the Guild of Glassblowers, Glaziers, and Spectacle-makers.</p><p>If you do business in the city as anything other than a purchaser of goods and services, I strongly advise you to seek out a local solicitor and pay to be guided through the process. No guild of solicitors exists, so be sure your choice comes highly recommended by individuals you can trust. To learn the peculiarities of any guild's rules, consult someone on duty at the guild headquarters or ask a senior guild member.</p><p>All that said, working at a guild-related profession without being a member of that guild isn't illegal. Guild members have no lawful recourse to interfere in the business of someone who chooses to not join the organization. But if you practice a trade or operate a business without becoming a member of the appropriate guild, word spreads, and you'll find that your coin isn't good for purchasing the goods or services of anyone who is a guild member. Since that group includes virtually everyone who sells the necessities of life or offers shelter for a fee, the benefits of joining a guild swiftly become apparent to those who procrastinate in this regard.</p>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/005_-_Volo_27s_Waterdeep_Enchiridion/003_-_Surviving_in_the_City/avatar.png"}

Xanathar wants this mechanical version of itself to hover over the crowd, reminding the Lords of Waterdeep of the beholder's superiority, but no one can figure out how to make it fly. A character can use an action to try to activate the machine, doing so with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. The activated beholder shoots dazzling lights from its eyestalks for 1 minute and then stops working.</p><p>If combat breaks out in the cellar complex, Thorvin Twinbeard flees up the stairs in area B8 and uses a key to unlock the door leading outside. He has no loyalty to the other creatures stationed here.</p><p><br></p><h4>Stone of Deception</h4><p>Korgstrod Uxgulm, the duergar leader, has what he believes to be the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>. He found it during a search of Fenerus's house in the Trades Ward. This stone is a clever imitation. It's gray and ovoid with streaks of black, but has no magical powers. Korgstrod has been unable to attune to it and assumes he's unworthy of it, not that the stone is fake.</p><p>Korgstrod plans to deliver the stone to Xanathar in due time and won't willingly part with it before then. He uses a whip to flog his kobold lackeys and keep them in line. The cowardly kobolds flee into the sewers if Korgstrod is attacked and cower in his presence otherwise.</p><p><br></p><h4>Treasure Chest</h4><p>An old, locked chest in the back of area B11b can be opened by someone who makes a successful DC 13 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The chest contains 277 cp, 135 sp, a spherical gold beholder pendant with tiny gems for eyes (worth 250 gp), and a <i>spell scroll of darkvision</i>.</p><p><br></p><h4>Next Encounter</h4><p>Whether they find the fake stone or not, characters have little recourse but to consult with “Laeral” at the Seven Masks Theater in the Dock Ward. If they go there, proceed with encounter 6, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTg0MGU5MWQ3Nzlk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Theater</a>.”</p></section>","img":""}

Lady Gralhund decides she no longer likes Urstul and, taking advantage of his injuries, wrests the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> from him at swordpoint and orders her guards to lock him up until she decides what to do with him.</p><p>Your choice of main villain determines Lady Gralhund's motivation, which is a secret held by her and Hrabbaz, her loyal half-orc bodyguard:</p><ul><li>If Xanathar is the main villain, Yalah Gralhund has secretly cut a deal with the beholder crime lord, offering to return the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> to it if the beholder helps her create a vacancy on the council of Masked Lords.</li><li>If the Cassalanters are the main villains, Yalah is a fawning member of their Asmodeus-worshiping cult and intends to deliver the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> to them as a demonstration of her fealty and friendship.</li><li>If Jarlaxle is the main villain, he and Yalah are secret lovers. He has promised to facilitate her rise in power after he uses Lord Neverember's lost hoard to buy Luskan's way into the Lords' Alliance.</li><li>If Manshoon is the main villain, he promised not to destroy Yalah's family if she allowed her villa to be used as a staging area for his secret plots. Believing that Urstul Floxin is after the gold for himself, Yalah plans to cut Urstul out of the deal and deliver the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> to Manshoon herself.</li></ul><p>Having gravely misjudged and underestimated Lady Gralhund once, Urstul isn't about to do so again. Rallying despite his injuries, he manages to kill the two inattentive Gralhund guards who were watching over him and alert the other Zhents on the estate, who begin dispatching the other guards and servants. Urstul's goal is to capture Lord or Lady Gralhund, force the surrender of the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>, and deliver it to his master <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2NlZDg4MzUzMjUw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Manshoon</a> in Kolat Towers (described in the Winter Wizardry add-on).</p><p>Urstul's plans—unbeknownst to him—are dashed when Lady Gralhund orders her nimblewright to take the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> elsewhere. Amid the chaos, the nimblewright flees the estate.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Should They or Shouldn't They?</span></h3><p>The characters must proceed carefully, since they have no evidence that directly implicates the Gralhunds in the attack in Trollskull Alley. Their two basic choices are to share what they know with the City Watch or to visit Gralhund Villa themselves.</p><h4>Let the Watch Handle It</h4><p>The characters can go to any City Watch station in the North Ward and report what they have learned to the constables there. Shortly thereafter, the characters receive a visit from <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Njc1NDI1MDQzNzEx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Barnibus Blastwind</a></b> and <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjEwMzU5ZWIzNDIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Saeth Cromley</a></b>, who have no reason to suspect the characters are lying. Their own investigation corroborates much of what the characters said. Barnibus concludes the meeting by saying, rather brusquely, “Thank you for the information.” Cromley adds, “Rest assured, we'll have this case resolved in no time.”</p><p>A magistrate provides the City Watch with a warrant to search Gralhund Villa. Sometime afterward, Cromley visits the characters by himself and, as a courtesy, tells them what happened:</p><ul><li>Officers arrived to find Lord Gralhund unconscious, Lady Gralhund in shock, and their half-orc bodyguard bloodied but unbowed.</li><li>Apparently, the Gralhunds had been held hostage for more than a tenday by agents of the Black Network. Most of the Zhents were killed during a bloody revolt led by Lord Gralhund himself.</li><li>The Zhent leader, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWU2N2EyYjA0ZTU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Urstul Floxin</a>, was among those who got away. He's still at large. The Watch plans to step up its search for him.</li><li>Of the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjZWI0MzEyNTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>nimblewright</a>, there was no sign. According to the Gralhunds, the construct was delivered to Gralhund Villa weeks earlier. The family took it in, not realizing it was a Zhentarim spy. Lady Gralhund reported that it stole her <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWE2OGNiYzA4OGI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>necklace of fireballs</a></i>.</li></ul><p>Cromley's summary of events is based on information given to the City Watch by the Gralhunds and is riddled with falsehoods. The hostage situation, Lord Gralhund's heroism, and the theft of Lady Gralhund's <i>necklace of fireballs</i> never happened. The nimblewright's affiliation with the Zhentarim is also a lie. The Gralhunds' account further doesn't explain why the nimblewright would use the <i>necklace of fireballs</i> to inflict harm on the Zhents if it was working with them. If characters raise that question, Cromley thinks for a moment and then ventures the guess that the nimblewright underestimated the necklace's explosive power.</p><h4>Investigate the Villa</h4><p>The characters can insert themselves into Gralhund Villa and accost its residents with impunity if they're careful to pin the violence on the Zhents or if they're able to enter and leave unseen before the City Watch shows up to arrest everyone.</p><p>Sneaking in or out of the villa without being seen or heard by neighbors and passersby requires each character to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check. A character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill can take disadvantage on the check to grant advantage on another party member's check (essentially compensating for a less stealthy companion).</p><p>If the characters side with the Gralhunds in the conflict, Lady Gralhund is inclined to overlook their trespass. Her demeanor sours, however, if they start asking too many questions. She vigorously denies accusations that her family is involved with the Black Network and claims the Zhents were holding her family hostage (a false claim also parroted by her husband, her bodyguard, her children, and her staff). If the characters assault any member of the household or brandish weapons in an attempt to intimidate, the Gralhunds inform the City Watch of the party's crimes.</p><p>During the characters' invasion of Gralhund Villa, the nimblewright flees the estate with the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i> (see chapter 4 for more information on its destination). If the characters are using Nim's <i>nimblewright detector</i> to track the nimblewright, the device lets them know that the nimblewright has fled the scene, but not the direction it went.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px\"><b>Overview</b></span></h3><p>Gralhund Villa sits in the middle of an upper-class residential neighborhood in the North Ward. Here are some general facts to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>The streets around the villa have pedestrians and coaches traveling along them at all hours, though traffic is heavier during the day.</li><li>The estate is enclosed by 12-foot-high stone walls that require a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to negotiate without the aid of climbing gear or magic.</li><li>Neighbors and bystanders alert the City Watch if they hear loud, disturbing noises (such as a thunderwave spell) coming from the estate or if they see anything suspicious. The Watch sends a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWZiMDMzYjQ1ZDUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mage</a></b> and six <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veterans</a></b> (one sergeant and five constables) to investigate, and it takes 1d6 + 4 minutes for this force to arrive.</li><li>All ceilings in the mansion are 20 feet high.</li></ul><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Encounters in the Villa</span></h3><p>The following encounter locations, keyed to map 3.1, describe the Gralhund estate as it stands when the characters first arrive. The Zhents have taken over the downstairs level of the mansion; the Gralhunds are fighting to hold the upstairs.</p><h4>G1. Locked Gates</h4><p>Through a set of ornate iron gates, the characters can see a yard with several large trees, as well as two footpaths that lead to a two-story brick mansion and eastward toward a detached coach house.</p><p>An <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZjQwOGI1MjRmOTJl ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>arcane lock</a></i> spell is cast on the gates. Forcing them open requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check, while picking the lock requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The spell doesn't bar members of the Gralhund family, their staff, their guards, or Lady Gralhund's nimblewright from opening the gates.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G2. Yard</span></h4><p>The estate is well tended. In spring and summer, large trees provide shade. The trees begin shedding leaves in the fall. By winter, their branches are stripped bare.</p><p><b><i>Balcony.</i></b> Through the trees, the characters can see a large balcony (area G17) enclosed by an iron railing above the mansion's main entrance. The balcony is 20 feet above ground level, and scaling the mansion's brick walls to reach it without the aid of climbing gear or magic requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p><b><i>Evil Groundskeeper.</i></b> The yard is looked after by a menacing groundskeeper named Hurv Taldred (LE male Illuskan <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjdlZTk1MWI3Y2Yw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cult fanatic</a></b>) and his two quiet <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2I4YjgwODAwNjQw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mastiffs</a></b>. The Gralhunds paid a necromancer to perform a ritual on Hurv and his mastiffs. After sundown, the physical forms of these figures melt away, and they become three <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2ExOTFiMDhmNjVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>shadows</a></b> until dawn. Characters who succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check can cross the yard without being detected. Otherwise, Hurv and his hounds detect the characters and attack, day or night.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G3. Coach House</span></h4><p>This stone building contains a beautifully maintained coach and clean stables that house four <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2U1NTExZjhlZDg1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>draft horses</a></b> and Lady Gralhund's jet-black <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTYyMmQwNjM3ZDIw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>riding horse</a></b>, named Maladar. A sliding wooden door bars access to the street and has a padlock on the outside that holds it shut. Picking the lock requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.</p><p>The larger room north of the stables contains tack and harness for each horse, as well as bales of hay and yard tools. The smaller room in the northwest corner has two cots: one for the groundskeeper, Hurv (see area G2), who sleeps during the day, and one for a stableboy named Ike (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b>), who sleeps here at night. Ike is away (either picking up food for the horses or out drinking with friends) if the characters arrive during the day.</p><p><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> Lady Gralhund's horse is outfitted with <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWExOTdlMWY2Mzhj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>horseshoes of speed</a></i> and two saddlebags, each of which holds four 5-pound gold trade bars worth 250 gp each.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G4. Guard Barracks</span></h4><p>This one-story stone building attached to the mansion serves as quarters for twenty house guards. The main room contains ten bunk beds. Each comes with a pair of footlockers containing folded clothes and worthless personal effects.</p><p>The room in the northwest corner contains wooden mannequins and racks designed to hold armor and weapons. Since there are no guards present, the mannequins and racks are bare.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G5. Kitchen</span></h4><p>An unlocked wooden door leads from the yard to the mansion's kitchen, which is stocked with cookware and utensils. A large fireplace is used for cooking meals.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G6. Pantry</span></h4><p>This pantry is lined with shelves containing dry foodstuffs, spices, folded tablecloths, and jars of preserves. Casks of fresh water, ale, and wine are also stored here.</p><p><b><i>Barred Door.</i></b> A back door leads out to the street. This sturdy wooden door is barred shut on the inside. Forcing it open from the outside requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check and makes a lot of noise.</p><p><b><i>Corpses.</i></b> The Zhents have killed two servants, an older male human (the head butler) and a younger male halfling (a cook), and left their bodies on the floor.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G7. Laundry Room</span></h4><p>This room is where servants wash clothing. It contains scrub buckets, wash basins, soap, mops, and chamber pots.</p><p><b><i>Corpses.</i></b> The Zhents have killed a servant, a middle-aged female human (the head maid), and left her body on the stairs leading up to the servants' quarters (area G19). The maid has a ring of keys on her belt that opens all the locked doors in the mansion as well as the cabinets in area G8.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G8. Great Hall</span></h4><p>Characters who enter this hall for the first time notice the following:</p><ul><li>The floor is strewn with bodies. Two <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjOTkwZDcyZDUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>thugs</a></b> holding bloody maces stand over them.</li><li>The sound of fighting can be heard coming from the top of a wide staircase in the northwest corner (see area G13).</li><li>Two iron chandeliers hang from the dark mahogany ceiling above a long dining table carved from red larchwood. Chairs surround the table, with a particularly tall and elaborate chair at each end.</li><li>Lining the wood-paneled walls are tapestries and locked wooden cabinets that contain fine dishes, silverware, and candlesticks.</li><li>A fireplace with a black marble mantelpiece has a framed family portrait mounted above it. (The portrait depicts Lord and Lady Gralhund, their three young children, and a family dog that died three years ago.)</li></ul><p><b><i>Corpses.</i></b> Lying about the room are the bodies of eight guards wearing bloody and tattered House Gralhund livery over their chain shirts, as well as two dead Zhents in black leather armor. All are humans.</p><p><b><i>Thugs.</i></b> The two figures with maces are Zhents clad in black leather armor. Their orders are to hold the room. They attack strangers, including members of the City Watch, on sight. They carry no treasure.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G9. Parlor</span></h4><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWU2N2EyYjA0ZTU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Urstul Floxin</a> was confined here when he returned to the villa, but shortly thereafter he killed his guards and escaped. The room is furnished for comfort and contains dainty chairs, a chaise longue, a wine cabinet, and framed paintings of various long-dead members of the Gralhund family.</p><p><b><i>Corpses.</i></b> The bodies of the two guards lie atop bloodsoaked rugs. The guards wear chain shirts and the livery of House Gralhund.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G10. Den and Trophy Room</span></h4><p>Lord Gralhund's den has the heads of various beasts mounted on the walls and gleaming suits of armor standing at attention in the corners. Bearskin rugs and overstuffed chairs fill the room.</p><p>Lord Gralhund recently took up falconry as a hobby. In the middle of the room, resting on a table, is a cage containing a hooded falcon (use <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkNGY3NDlhNDcz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>hawk</a></b> statistics).</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G11. Orond's Study</span></h4><p>The door to this room is locked. The lock can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The room has these features:</p><ul><li>A 10-foot-square canvas wrestling mat is sprawled on the floor in the middle of the room.</li><li>Velvet armchairs, small statues of naked men on pedestals, and tall mahogany bookshelves are arranged neatly around the room.</li><li>A mahogany desk in one corner doesn't look like it sees much use.</li></ul><p><b><i>Books.</i></b> Most of the books are fake boxes made of painted cardboard. A few have bawdy drawings and salacious poems hidden inside them.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G12. Family Library</span></h4><p>The wood-paneled library includes these features:</p><ul><li>Tall bookshelves are packed with tomes. Sliding wooden ladders mounted on rails allow easy access to higher shelves.</li><li>In one corner stands an iron lectern with a closed, locked, leather-bound tome resting on it.</li><li>Two padded chairs face a large fireplace. One has a wolf skin draped over it.</li></ul><p><b><i>Books.</i></b> Many of the books were handed down to Lady Gralhund by her parents, and they are well kept. They include historical texts, play scripts, novels, and poetry collections.</p><p><b><i>Locked Tome.</i></b> Although it looks like it might be a spellbook, the tome on the lectern is a chronicle of the Gralhund family's accomplishments, embellished or recast to paint the family in the most favorable light. A <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NGViNGI3MTJmYzQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect magic</a></i> spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic emanating from the tome.</p><p>The tome is meant to be unlocked using a key that Lady Gralhund wears on a chain around her neck. The lock can be picked by a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or it can be opened with a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YTA5OGI2YzliM2Zj ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>knock</a></i> spell or similar magic. Opening the book by any means other than using the proper key causes three <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDk5NzRkMmI0Nzg1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>specters</a></b> to appear within 10 feet of the book and attack its opener. The magic that binds the specters has weakened over time; they can exist on the Material Plane for only 1 minute, after which time they are banished to the Ethereal Plane (unless destroyed first). The specters manifest as ghostly tieflings with elongated fingers.</p><p>The Gralhund family crest appears on the book's title page. The rest of the book is written in Common and describes births, deaths, and other family events between 1239 DR, the Year of the Bloodied Sword, and 1422 DR, the Year of Advancing Shadows. Of particular note is the little-known fact that the Gralhunds forged pacts with devils in years past, giving rise to a strain of tieflings. All such members of the house were sent to live on a Gralhund estate in Yartar, a city far to the north (or so the book claims in its epilogue), and there are passing references to some Waterdavian family members having been born with tails.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G13. Upstairs Foyer</span></h4><p>A lot is happening in this elegant foyer:</p><ul><li>A battle rages between several Zhents and house guards, and the floor is strewn with dead bodies.</li><li>Doors to the master bedroom (area G16) stand open. (If Lady Gralhund is in the master bedroom, she shouts, “The City Watch is on the way!”)</li><li>The door to area G15a is ajar. Beyond it, characters can hear someone putting a boot to another door.</li></ul><p><b><i>Corpses.</i></b> Lying on the floor are the corpses and weapons of six guards wearing House Gralhund livery over chain shirts and two Zhents in black leather armor.</p><p><b><i>Fight in Progress.</i></b> Four <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veterans</a></b> of House Gralhund (each with 30 hit points remaining) are fighting off an attacking force of Zhents consisting of three <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjOTkwZDcyZDUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>thugs</a></b> (each with 20 hit points remaining). The Zhents are trying to get to area G16, but the guards are blocking them.<br></p><p>If the characters do nothing to affect the outcome of this fight, assume that it ends with three House Gralhund veterans still alive and all the Zhents dead.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G14. Ballroom</span></h4><p>The door to this room is locked. A character using thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The ballroom is unoccupied and contains the following features:</p><ul><li>Gilded mirrors, tasseled tapestries, and stained-glass lamps festoon the walls. Mounted above a fireplace is a stag's head made of blown glass.</li><li>The veined marble floor is polished to a mirrorlike sheen.</li><li>Tacky crystal chandeliers dangle from the ceiling, which has a mural depicting an orgy painted on it.</li></ul><hr><h4>G15. Guest Suite</h4><p>Until recently, this suite was set aside for the use of Urstul Floxin. Lord Gralhund has barricaded himself in area G15b, using heavy furniture to block the door. Forcing it open requires a successful DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p>The characters encounter <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWU2N2EyYjA0ZTU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Urstul Floxin</a></b>&nbsp;in area G15a. Urstul is wounded with 50 hit points remaining and has no poison coating his weapons, reducing his challenge rating to 3 (700 XP). He's trying to kick open the door to area G15b in a desperate attempt to capture Lord Gralhund and trade him for the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>. If he is accosted before reaching Lord Gralhund, Urstul tries to flee the villa and uses any other surviving Zhents to cover his escape. He knows the same information that Lord Gralhund does (see “Orond Gralhund” below) but won't divulge it or the name of his master, Manshoon, unless he's magically compelled to do so.</p><p>Area G15a is a bathroom. A curtain to the east has been drawn back, revealing a claw-footed bathtub.</p><p>Area G15b is a wood-paneled bedchamber with a birdcage on a table and a permanent teleportation circle inscribed on the floor. The birdcage contains three <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YWRlYjJiZTUyZTBh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>flying snakes</a></b> that Urstul uses to deliver messages to his spies throughout the city. The circle is used by Manshoon to meet secretly with Urstul Floxin and to teleport Zhents to and from Kolat Towers (see the Winter Wizardry add-on). See the <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells%3ATeleporation%20Circle\">teleportation circle</a></i> spell description in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for more information on how the circle functions.</p><p><b><i>Orond Gralhund.</i></b> Having blocked the bedroom door with a wardrobe, a desk, and an overstuffed chair, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDE0NTFkOTMyMzMw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Orond Gralhund</a> cowers behind a bed in the southwest corner of area G15b. Although he's armed with a rapier, Orond throws himself at the mercy of the first person to bust through his barricade.</p><p>Characters who have Lord Gralhund at their mercy can pry the following information from him with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check, but the check is made with disadvantage if Lord Gralhund has reason to believe his wife can see or overhear the conversation:</p><ul><li>“The <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i> is some kind of ancient creature transformed into an artifact. It knows the location of a hidden vault in Waterdeep containing half a million dragons.”</li><li>“House Gralhund has been bankrolling Black Network operations in Waterdeep, including the plot to kidnap <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjVkOTBiZjc2MjEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Renaer Neverember</a> and the plot to steal the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> from his father's gnome spy, Dalakhar.”</li><li>“My wife was frustrated with the Zhents and their inability to secure the artifact. She gave a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWE2OGNiYzA4OGI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>necklace of fireballs</a></i> to her mechanical servant and sent it out to help retrieve the stone. It was careless and caught the Zhents in the fireball by mistake.”</li></ul><hr><h4>G16. Master Bedroom</h4><p>The doors to this room have been thrown open. The room contains the following occupants and features:</p><ul><li><b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWY2MzkxNmQ3MzUw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Yalah Gralhund</a></b>, wearing a breastplate and armed with a rapier, stands next to her well-dressed half-orc bodyguard, <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTA2YmU5ODFiZTVj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Hrabbaz</a></b>.</li><li>A locked wooden trunk rests at the foot of a large, canopied bed in the southwest corner.</li><li>A claw-footed bathtub sits in the northwest alcove near a freestanding mirror and a privacy screen.</li><li>Hanging above a fireplace in the southeast corner is a shield that bears the Gralhund coat of arms. Logs are stacked neatly next to the hearth.</li><li>A tall mahogany wardrobe stuffed with expensive gowns and dress clothes stands next to a pair of open glass doors leading out to a balcony.</li></ul><p><b><i>Yalah Gralhund.</i></b> Lady Gralhund gave the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> and a map of where to take it to her nimblewright servant, who has left the villa by the time the characters reach this chamber. Its escape is crucial, since it sets into motion the events in chapter 4.</p><p>Lady Gralhund and Hrabbaz are the only people who know where the nimblewright has gone, but they feign ignorance when questioned about it.</p><p>Yalah carries a ring of keys that open all locked doors in the mansion, as well as the locked wooden trunk at the foot of the bed. If her situation turns dire and Hrabbaz is unable to protect her, Yalah unlocks the door to area G18, rushes inside, and locks the door behind her with her next action. She makes her final stand there, with her children cowering behind her.</p><p><b><i>Wooden Trunk.</i></b> The lock on the trunk can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The trunk appears to contain folded clothes and shoes. A secret compartment in the bottom can be detected by someone who examines the outside of the trunk and makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The compartment holds two holy symbols of Asmodeus and two robes, each red and gold in color. Lord and Lady Gralhund are both secret members of a cult of Asmodeus worshipers popular among select nobles in Waterdeep. The cult is led by Lord <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjgxY2IxOTdjYWJj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Victoro Cassalanter</a>, though the Gralhunds won't divulge this information willingly.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G17. Balcony</span></h4><p>This large balcony is enclosed by an ornate wrought-iron railing and has lounge chairs neatly arranged on it. The ground is 20 feet below, and open glass doors lead to the master bedroom (area G16).</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G18. Children's Room</span></h4><p>The door to this room is locked. The lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.</p><p>Three beds line the south wall, and an empty cradle rests against the east wall. Other furnishings include squat wardrobes, play rugs, and children's desks.</p><p><b><i>Children.</i></b> Confined here for their safety are the Gralhunds' two youngest children, a 13-year-old boy named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTZkMDM3MzcwMjYx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Zartan</a> and a 10-year-old boy named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDA0ODIwODhiZjVi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Greth</a>. Both are noncombatants. Their 18-year-old sister, Tomassin, is visiting a tiefling cousin in Yartar.</p><hr><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">G19. Servants' Wing</span></h4><p>Three rooms in the southeast area of the upper floor are where the servants sleep at night. The head butler and head maid have rooms to themselves, but those places are currently unoccupied. The largest of the three chambers is a common room containing six bunk beds for the junior staff. A total of nine maids, cooks, and valets (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></b>) are holed up here, waiting for someone to rescue them. They are armed with improvised weapons (rolling pins, mops, brooms, and the like) that are treated as clubs.</p><hr><h2><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 24px ; font-weight: bold\">Aftermath</span></h2><p>After fleeing Gralhund Villa with the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>, Lady Gralhund's <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjZWI0MzEyNTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>nimblewright</a> hides the artifact in a secret location in Waterdeep, setting the stage for chapter 4.</p><p>Even if the bloody conflict at Gralhund Villa goes unnoticed outside the walls of the estate, the carnage can't be hidden from the City Watch for long. There are too many murdered servants and guards for anyone to conceal what has transpired. The arrival of the City Watch foreshadows the return of <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Njc1NDI1MDQzNzEx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Barnibus Blastwind</a></b> and <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjEwMzU5ZWIzNDIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Saeth Cromley</a></b>, who arrive in due course with twenty constables (<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veterans</a></b>) and two <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTA1MjdiYTRiNjVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Griffon Cavalry riders</a> </b>astride <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWMxMWRkMjRjMTE0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>griffons</a></b>. The griffons and their riders remain airborne, providing aerial support and reconnaissance.</p><p>Barnibus thoroughly investigates the Gralhund Villa crime scene and questions neighbors and bystanders. Characters who are seen leaving the scene become suspects. If the characters killed any members of the Gralhund family and left witnesses or evidence of the act, Barnibus instructs Sergeant Cromley to arrest them for the crime of murdering a noble, which carries a death sentence if they're found guilty.</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/003_-_Chapter_3_3A_Fireball/005_-_Gralhund_Villa/avatar.png"}

An eccentric Waterdavian artist lives here, and she hasn't been the same since her true love abandoned her. There are no squatters in the residence.</p><p>The outside doors are always locked. A lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check by a character using thieves' tools, or a door can be smashed open with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Any attempt to break into the tower is 75 percent likely to be seen or heard by one of Kalain's neighbors. Eight <b>veterans</b> of the City Watch arrive 10 minutes later to investigate the intrusion.</p><p><br></p><h3>Let Me Paint You a Picture</h3><p>Kalain, a famous Waterdavian painter, was commissioned to paint a portrait of Lord Dagult Neverember, then Waterdeep's Open Lord, in 1475 DR. Her meeting with Neverember marked the beginning of a torrid love affair that lasted over a year. One of the many gifts he lavished on her was an estate in the Sea Ward.</p><p>Their relationship faltered as Dagult's visits to Neverwinter became more frequent and extended. He made promises to Kalain that he failed to keep, and when she raised the subject of faithful commitment, he treated her poorly, for his true love was Neverwinter. Kalain became enraged after Dagult's rejection and turned to painting monsters that, in her mind, represented him. Her power to harness the Weave clings to the fabric of her works, giving her the ability to bring these monsters to life on command.</p><p>Ultimately, Neverember used his influence to ruin Kalain and divorce her from Waterdeep's high society. She was allowed to keep her home, but her works and her reputation were destroyed, slowly and methodically. Kalain's spirit was broken, leading to the onset of madness. Now she locks herself away, content to let time erode the last of her conscience. She always saw Dagult and Waterdeep as one and the same, and now they are both her mortal enemies.</p><p><br></p><h4>Visiting the Residence</h4><p>Kalain is unable to behave politely before strangers, for she believes they're all assassins sent by Dagult Neverember to murder her. The only person with whom she's civil is Vhaspar Holmdreg (LG male Illuskan human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTUxNTA4ZTNjY2M3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>priest</a></b>), who rents a room in the west wing of the residence and works in the North Ward at the Hospice of St. Laupsenn, a temple of Ilmater, god of suffering. Vhaspar is an old man in his seventies, half blind with cataracts, who brings her food twice a week, firewood three times a week in the winter, and painting supplies every few months. Vhaspar has a key that unlocks the outer doors of Kalain's residence.</p><p>Displayed in every room except area W5 is one of Kalain's paintings. To determine the subject of any given painting, roll a d12 and consult the Painting Subjects table. It's possible for a subject to appear more than once. The residence is also crawling with rats. If Kalain is attacked, these vermin form six <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZmQ1NGIyNzVkN2Zi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swarms of rats</a></b> that defend her.</p><p><b>Painting Subjects</b><br></p><table class=\"userscript-table userscript-table-bordered\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align: center\">d12</th><th>Subject</th><th style=\"text-align: center\">d12</th><th>Subject</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">1</td><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDgxNjZjNzNiMTAz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ankheg</a><br></td><td style=\"text-align: center\">7</td><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGIxMzBjOGNhM2U5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Gibbering mouther</a><br></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">2</td><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjM1ZmI4Mzc5Y2Qw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Carrion crawler</a><br></td><td style=\"text-align: center\">8</td><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTNiZjAxYWI4N2Rh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Hell hound</a><br></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">3</td><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzYwZGNjN2EzMDMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Displacer beast</a><br></td><td style=\"text-align: center\">9</td><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjI5ODdiN2RhODMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Manticore</a><br></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">4</td><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Nzc0MDhkMjI4MGYx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ettercap</a><br></td><td style=\"text-align: center\">10</td><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTQxODY2ODliMzk4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Minotaur</a><br></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">5</td><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2RhNGUyYzk4YTJm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Gargoyle</a><br></td><td style=\"text-align: center\">11</td><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjgzMWUyZjE1MmUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Mummy</a><br></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">6</td><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGEyMjQyZmVmNjc2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ghast</a><br></td><td style=\"text-align: center\">12</td><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Mzg2N2QwMTNjMTNh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Werewolf</a><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><br></h4><h4>Kalain</h4><p>Kalain spends most of her time in area W5, which serves as her studio. It contains moldy scraps of food, empty pots stained with colored paint, discarded brushes, and her easel, which is situated in front of a large, lead-paned window in the north wall. Upon the easel rests a fresh painting of a displacer beast. If the characters confront her, Kalain accuses them of being assassins, brings the <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzYwZGNjN2EzMDMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>displacer beast</a></b> to life, and commands it to attack them.</p><p><b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWU4NTY0ZDdhMTgz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Kalain</a></b> is a half-elf bard.</p><p><b><i>Art Imitates Life (3/Day).</i></b> Kalain touches one of her paintings and causes its subject to spring forth, becoming a creature of that kind provided its CR is 3 or lower. The creature appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the painting, which becomes blank. The creature is friendly toward Kalain and hostile toward all others. It rolls initiative to determine when it acts. It disappears after 1 minute, when it is reduced to 0 hit points, or when Kalain dies or falls unconscious.</p><p><br></p><h4>Path to the Vault</h4><p>A heavy stone trapdoor in the floor of area W4a can be found with a thorough search of the room and a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. Pulling open the door reveals a stone staircase that descends 120 feet to a 20-foot-wide corridor, which extends for another 60 feet and ends before the doors to the Vault of Dragons. Kalain and Vhaspar know nothing of the vault or the trapdoor that leads to it.</p></section>","img":""}

After that, they aren't allowed anywhere near the bodies, although invisible and similarly hidden characters can search the crime scene further. A search of the bodies accompanied by a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the following:</p><ul><li>One of the dead male humans has a black, winged snake (the symbol of the Black Network) tattooed on his right forearm.</li><li>The dead gnome has dry waste on his boots and cloak, suggesting he has spent time in the sewers recently. He also has a pouch containing five 100 gp gemstones.</li></ul><p>A character can try to snatch Dalakhar's pouch without being seen by NPC onlookers, doing so with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a failed check, the character still acquires the pouch, but someone observes the theft and reports it to City Watch constables once they show up (see “The Watch Arrives” in&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmQzNmJkMWQ1ZDEy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>After the Blast</a>).

To one side of the vault doors, a natural fissure in the wall once served as a grick's lair, but Esvele killed the grick and left its corpse on the floor.</span></p></span></section>","img":""}

Teleporting into the vault from outside is impossible.</li><li>Walls are made of mortared stone. Doors are solid stone slabs with stone handles and hinges.</li><li>Except in area V9, there are no light sources.</li></ul><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Areas of the Vault</span></h3><p>The following locations are keyed to map 4.9.</p><p><br></p><h4>V1. Vault Door</h4><p>A 20-foot-high, 20-foot-wide stone corridor ends before an adamantine double door bearing Dwarvish runes. The doors have neither handles nor hinges. The writing on them reads, “THE THREE KEYS. BRING THEM FORTH.”</p><p>The doors part, sliding back into the walls, when the three correct keys are brought with 5 feet of them. They remain open until Aurinax or someone else speaks the command word to close them (“Azaam”). The keys can open the doors from either side. The doors can't be forced open or damaged in any way, and attempts to circumvent them with magic fail automatically.</p><p><br></p><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">V2. Entrance Foyer</span></h4><p>This vast chamber has the following features:</p><ul><li>Three age-worn columns support crumbling stone bridges 60 feet overhead, with the ceiling rising another 20 feet beyond that.</li><li>Set into alcoves are twelve sets of double doors made of iron. Each door is 10 feet wide, 10 feet high, and embossed with images of dwarf warriors in plate armor.</li></ul><p><b><i>Crumbling Bridges.</i></b> The bridges connect area V4 to adamantine doors that seal off areas V6, V7, and V8. The eastern half of the northern bridge and the western half of the southern bridge are unstable. Either bridge collapses if more than 150 pounds of weight is applied to it. A creature standing on a section of bridge when it collapses must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 60 feet to the floor below.</p><p>The middle bridge has a 15-foot-wide gap in it. A character can clear this gap with a running jump—but part of the bridge breaks away under the character's feet on landing, forcing the character to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the floor below.</p><p><b><i>Iron Doors.</i></b> Ten of the double doors are false and refuse to budge. The two sets of doors at the northern end of the west wall push open to reveal area V3 beyond.</p><h4><br></h4><h4>V3. Stairs and Fresco</h4><p>This hall has the following features:</p><ul><li>At the south end of this chamber, expertly carved stairs climb 70 feet to area V4.</li><li>The north wall bears a 20-foot-square fresco that depicts dwarves battling goblins.</li></ul><p><b><i>Enthralling Fresco.</i></b> A <i>detect magic</i> spell reveals an aura of enchantment magic on the fresco. Any creature within 30 feet of the fresco that can see it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by it for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature can't willingly move out of sight of the fresco and defends it to the death. If forcibly moved away from the fresco, the creature tries to find its way back. The creature can't rest while under this effect. After 24 hours, the creature gains one level of exhaustion and can repeat the saving throw if it can still see the fresco, ending the effect on a success. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the effect of the fresco for 24 hours. Destroying at least one 10-foot-square section of the fresco ends the effect for all creatures. Each 10-foot-square section has AC 17, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\"><br></span></p><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">V4. Hall of Moradin</span></h4><p>This 20-foot-high hall has the following features:</p><ul><li>Three pillars running the length of the hall are carved to resemble warhammers, with their square heads pressed against the floor.</li><li>The west wall bears a cracked mosaic that depicts a dwarf smith at a forge, crafting dwarves out of black metal and diamonds. (In the south end of the wall is a secret door.)</li><li>Three archways in the east wall lead to crumbling bridges that span the entrance foyer (area V2) and end in front of adamantine doors (leading to areas V6, V7, and V8).</li></ul><p><b><i>Black Pudding.</i></b> A little more than halfway down the hall, a section of the western mural has broken off, forming a heap of shattered tile on the floor. A crack in the wall conceals a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzRhNDNmZGE3YmFl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>black pudding</a></b> that gushes out and attacks characters who inspect the damage.</p><p><b><i>Secret Door.</i></b> A character who searches the hall for secret doors and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the outline of a secret door that leads to area V5. The door opens automatically when a dwarf (or a creature transformed into a dwarf with an <i>alter self</i> spell or similar magic) touches it; otherwise, a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check is needed to push open the heavy door.</p><h4><br></h4><h4>V5. Secret Room</h4><p>This dust-filled room has lain untouched since the time of the Delzoun dwarves. Green copper urns on platforms overflow with coins, gems, and more.</p><p><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> This room holds five copper urns (worth 25 gp each). Urn 1 contains five tourmalines (worth 100 gp each) mixed in with 200 cp. Urn 2 contains a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGQyM2I4YTRiM2Zh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>ring of warmth</a></i> mixed in with ten ordinary gold rings (worth 25 gp each) and 650 sp. Urn 3 is piled high with 250 gp. Urn 4 holds 33 blue quartz gemstones (worth 10 gp each). Urn 5 holds a 9-inch-tall silver statuette of a dwarf priest of Moradin with amethyst eyes (worth 250 gp and weighing 10 pounds).</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\"><br></span></p><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">V6. Hammer and Anvil</span></h4><p>The adamantine door to this room has an arcane lock spell cast on it, but it swings open when a dwarf or a creature transformed into a dwarf touches it. Another creature can force it open with a successful DC 21 Strength (Athletics) check. A <i>knock</i> spell or similar magic also opens it. The door swings into the room on stiff adamantine hinges.</p><ul><li>The north, east, and south walls of this 20-foot-high room are adorned with dust-covered frescoes depicting dwarf smiths at work in their forges.</li><li>An iron anvil sits atop a raised stone block in the middle of the floor. Both fixtures are draped in cobwebs.</li></ul><p><b><i>Frescoes.</i></b> A character who inspects the wall frescoes and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that the stone hammer being wielded by the smith in the fresco on the south wall can be taken away from where it rests. When removed, it leaves a hammer-shaped indentation in the wall. Etched into the side of the hammer that was facing the wall is the following inscription in Dwarvish runes: “Let hearts be lifted and battles won.” The hammer must be removed from its indentation for the inscription to be seen.</p><p><b><i>Iron Anvil.</i></b> If the characters clear away the cobwebs, they see an inscription on the front of the stone block. Written in Dwarvish runes, it reads as follows: “Let the hammer fall and the anvil ring.”</p><p>If the anvil is struck by the stone hammer that was taken from the wall, each creature in the room that can hear the anvil ring gains 10 temporary hit points that last for 24 hours. Once the anvil has bestowed this gift, it can't do so again for 24 hours.</p><h4><br></h4><h4>V7. Dumathoin's Secret</h4><p>This room is sealed by an adamantine door similar to the one in area V6. The room contains the following features:</p><ul><li>Four suits of rusted plate armor sans helmets, sized for a dwarf, stand in the corners of this 20-foot-high room. Each suit is draped in cobwebs.</li><li>Dwarvish runes are carved into the far wall. The inscription reads, “A secret never before told will part Dumathoin's lips.”</li></ul><p>A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Religion) check identifies Dumathoin as the dwarven god of secrets. Any dwarf character automatically knows this.</p><p><b><i>Secret Stair.</i></b> The engraving on the wall is a clue that this room holds a secret, specifically a trapdoor so well hidden that it can't be found by using magic or searching. But when any creature in the room speaks aloud a secret, the trapdoor flips open, giving access to a spiral stone staircase that descends 120 feet to area V9. The spoken admission must be true, and it must be something the character has not previously revealed.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\"><br></span></p><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">V8. Ol' Fire Eyes</span></h4><p>This room has the following features:</p><ul><li>A 10-foot-tall painted statue of an armored male dwarf wielding a battleaxe and wearing a mask stands at the back of this 20-foot-high room.</li><li>Before the statue, set into the floor, is an adamantine trapdoor with a pull ring along one side.</li></ul><p><b><i>Trap.</i></b> A successful DC 17 Intelligence (Religion) check enables a character to recognize the statue as a depiction of Gorm Gulthyn, the dwarven god of vigilance also known as Fire Eyes. The statue melds seamlessly with the floor and can't be toppled. It also seems impervious to damage. A <i>detect magic</i> spell reveals an aura of evocation magic on the statue.</p><p>The trapdoor is false and can't be lifted. Anyone who touches the trapdoor or its pull ring must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by rays of magical fire that spring from the statue's eyes, dealing 22 (4d10) fire damage. The trap doesn't trigger if the target has total cover.</p><p><br></p><h4>V9. Main Vault</h4><p>When the characters arrive here for the first time, read:</p><blockquote><p>Although deep underground, this vault is lit by streams of sunlight that pour down from the ceiling, catching motes of dust in their luminous pools. Ornate columns support a thirty-foot-high vaulted ceiling, which is adorned with carvings of dwarves basking in the presence of their gods. Deep alcoves line the walls, and piled in one of them is a vast golden trove.</p><p>Out of the dusty gloom steps an aged dwarf clutching a staff carved and painted to resemble a pair of entwined dragons—one red, one gold. Despite the dwarf's age, his eyes are steady and bright. “I wasn't expecting anyone,” he says plainly. “As you can see, the place is a mess. Perhaps you should come back later, after I've tidied up a bit.”</p></blockquote><p>The dwarf, who calls himself Barok Clanghammer, is really the adult gold dragon <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Nzc4Njk2OWM4YzRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Aurinax</a></b>&nbsp;in disguise. He guards the gold for Lord Dagult Neverember and holds the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWZjODc0ZDQ3ODBh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</a></i>&nbsp;in exchange for his services. Dealing with the gold dragon presents an unusual challenge for the characters, and a peaceful resolution is more likely to benefit them than a violent one.<br></p><p>Aurinax is patient, wise, merciful, and vigilant. He remains in humanoid form until combat breaks out, since he can't easily carry the <i>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</i> in dragon form. The dragon attacks only in defense of itself, the staff, or the gold. The only individuals authorized to remove the gold under Aurinax's watch are Dagult Neverember and his appointed vassals, none of whom are currently in Waterdeep.</p><p>The characters can try to convince Aurinax that they have come on Neverember's behalf. Since he has never met them before or heard Neverember mention them by name, Aurinax is doubtful of their story. Fooling the dragon requires each character within his line of sight to succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the dragon's Wisdom (Insight) check. If even one character loses the contest, Aurinax senses that the group is lying to him. These checks are made with advantage if Renaer Neverember is with the party, since the dragon remembers meeting Renaer when he was but a child and can easily imagine a scenario in which Dagult Neverember might use his son as his vassal. (The dragon knows nothing of the animosity between Renaer and his father.)</p><p>The characters can try to convince the noble dragon that Lord Neverember embezzled the gold from the people of Waterdeep, and that it would be fair and just to see the coin safely returned to its rightful owners. Deep down, Aurinax knows where the gold came from, but the dragon has allowed his greed and his agreement with Lord Neverember to cloud his moral judgment. With a successful DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check, a character can talk the dragon into allowing the gold to be returned to the people to whom it rightfully belongs. The check is made with advantage if the characters brought a prominent city official with them, such as Mirt or Vajra Safahr, or if one of the characters professes to be a worshiper of Bahamut.</p><p>Any Charisma (Intimidation) check made to influence Aurinax automatically fails. After the first such attempt, all future Charisma checks made by the party to influence Aurinax have disadvantage.</p><p>Aurinax uses Legendary Resistance to avoid being charmed. If a character tries to charm him with a spell and fails, all future Charisma checks made by the party to influence Aurinax have disadvantage.</p><p><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> Choose two alcoves in the vault. Piled in one alcove are 500,000 gp, the combined weight of which is 10,000 pounds. Scattered on the floor of the second alcove are sixty-five 100 gp gemstones—all that remains of Aurinax's current food supply.</p><p>Aurinax won't give up his gemstones or the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWZjODc0ZDQ3ODBh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</a></i> willingly, since they are his payment for guarding the gold. If need be, however, the dragon is willing to use the staff's power on behalf of the city in exchange for more gemstones.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Leaving the Vault</span></h3><p>As the characters leave the vault, with or without the gold, they are confronted by a hostile force sent by the main villain or villains. If the vault doors were left open, the characters encounter these antagonists in area V2; otherwise, they're lurking outside the vault, waiting for the characters to emerge:</p><ul><li>If Xanathar is the main villain, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGI3Yzc4Zjc5YTU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Noska Ur'gray</a> arrives with six <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGY0YWQ5YzhmY2E0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bugbears</a></b> and a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDk4ZTg3ZjFiYjJm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>gazer</a></b>. If Noska is dead or otherwise indisposed, the beholder replaces him with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmNiZTI1MmI3ZDNi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Nar'l Xibrindas</a> and his <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGZlNTA1NjMwZGRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>grell</a></b> bodyguard.</li><li>If the Cassalanters are the villains, they send three <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjdlZTk1MWI3Y2Yw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cult fanatics</a></b> and three <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjQ0NjQxNWYxZTQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a></b>. Victoro's doppelganger manservant, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2Q4Njg3MjlkYmNj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Willifort Crowelle</a>, leads the group in his tiefling guise unless the characters killed him or otherwise disposed of him earlier in this chapter or in chapter 6.</li><li>If <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkMzA3NzY2ZmMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jarlaxle Baenre</a>&nbsp;</b>is the villain, he arrives with three <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkM2E1NjA1ZmRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow gunslingers</a></b>.

If Agorn and Vevette were killed or otherwise disposed of earlier in this chapter or in the course of Winter Wizardry, replace each of them with one additional <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNjOTkwZDcyZDUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>thug</a></b>.</li></ul><p>The forces sent by Xanathar, the Cassalanters, and Manshoon attack the characters on sight. Jarlaxle, on the other hand, congratulates characters for unlocking the Vault of Dragons and allows them to leave on the condition that they go empty-handed. He intends to see the gold safely returned to the city of Waterdeep but also demands the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWZjODc0ZDQ3ODBh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</a></i> for his trouble.</p><p>If <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Nzc4Njk2OWM4YzRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Aurinax</a> is alive, the characters can lure enemies to the dragon. Aurinax attacks any creature that attacks him or tries to steal his staff or the gold. He also defends the characters if he has made a deal with them.</p><h4>Faction Reinforcements</h4><p>If the characters joined one or more factions in Waterdeep and kept them informed of their progress, you can have reinforcements arrive to help combat the villains or introduce a new element to the situation.</p><p><b><i>Bregan D'aerthe.</i></b> If <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkMzA3NzY2ZmMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jarlaxle Baenre</a></b>&nbsp;isn't the main villain, he arrives with his lieutenants, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTJiNGJlNTc2MjQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Fel'rekt Lafeen</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTBhNjQwNTY2MDFk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Krebbyg Masq'il'yr</a>, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjlkNzNjNWM5ZTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Soluun Xibrindas</a>, or three other <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkM2E1NjA1ZmRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow gunslingers</a></b>. Jarlaxle offers to help the characters if they agree to help him secure the gold for Waterdeep and the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWZjODc0ZDQ3ODBh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>dragonstaff of Ahghairon</a></i> for himself.</p><p><b><i>Harpers.</i></b>&nbsp;<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWJlODY4YWM1OGRk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Mirt</a></b>&nbsp;arrives with two female human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWVkYjViNmM0MWEz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swashbucklers</a></b>.

Once the characters are no longer in peril, the rats disperse throughout the vault.</p><p><b><i>Force Grey.</i></b> Vajra Safahr sends <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDNjNGQ4ZmEwZTli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Meloon Wardragon</a></b>&nbsp;to help the characters secure the vault, unaware that Meloon has fallen under Xanathar's sway. If <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzMyNGExNTJhZjA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Xanathar</a> is the main villain, Meloon helps the beholder's forces defeat the characters.</p><p><b><i>Lords' Alliance.</i></b> Open Lord <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWM1M2NkZmE0YmI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Laeral Silverhand</a></b>&nbsp;arrives with <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTM2MDgyNjViNmYw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jalester Silvermane</a></b>&nbsp;and six City Guard <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veterans</a></b> to help characters secure the gold. Laeral's arrival forces Jarlaxle to be on his best behavior. After assuring Laeral of his good intentions, Jarlaxle cuts his losses and withdraws peacefully. If she is able to speak with Aurinax, Laeral convinces the dragon to relinquish the gold into her custody.<br></p><p><b><i>Order of the Gauntlet.</i></b>&nbsp;<b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjhmYjUxZDliYTNh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Hlam</a></b>&nbsp;arrives and aids the characters as best he can. He and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Nzc4Njk2OWM4YzRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Aurinax</a> met each other many years ago, and they are on fair speaking terms. Aurinax is fond of the monk, and characters who negotiate with the dragon in Hlam's presence gain advantage on their Charisma (Persuasion) checks.</p><p><b><i>Zhentarim.</i></b> The Doom Raiders (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDI0OGJlYjdlMzI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Istrid Horn</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDBkZmExNzM3Yzg4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Skeemo Weirdbottle</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODk1MGQ3ZjBmZWQw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tashlyn Yafeera</a>, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDI3MzRjNGM5OTAw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ziraj the Hunter</a>) arrive to help secure the vault, less any members who have been arrested or killed.

If they and the characters emerge victorious, the surviving Doom Raiders propose to split the take evenly with the characters. If the characters refuse this offer and the Doom Raiders outnumber them, the Zhents turn against them, putting characters who are Zhentarim members in a predicament.</p><hr><h2><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 24px ; font-weight: bold\">Adventure Conclusion</span></h2><p>The adventure could play out in any of several ways, depending on who gets the gold and what's done with the treasure.</p><h3>Dying in the Vault</h3><p>If the characters die in the Vault of Dragons with the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i> and the main villain doesn't know the vault's location, the secrets of the vault die with them.

If the characters refuse to give it up, they are stripped of any memberships they might hold in these factions and quickly find themselves in political hot water. The Lords of Waterdeep charge them with the crime of robbery against the citizens of the city. The characters face up to 1 month of hard labor plus damages equal to the value of the stolen currency plus 500 gp. If they try to flee the city, the City Guard apprehends and imprisons them. If they somehow evade the local authorities, the Harpers and agents of the Lords' Alliance pursue them tirelessly.</p><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWM1M2NkZmE0YmI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Laeral Silverhand</a> is prepared to let the characters keep one-tenth of the treasure (50,000 gp) for themselves. Even that much coin attracts unwanted attention, in the form of several people who beg loans or donations from them:</p><ul><li>Emmek Frewn (see “Business Rival: Emmek Frewn” in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MjYyMzY5NTRlNWFh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Open for Business?</a>) needs 1,500 gp to pay off a loan with interest. If he doesn't repay the coin in a tenday, <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDI0OGJlYjdlMzI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Istrid Horn</a></b>&nbsp;sends Zhentarim thugs to threaten, if not hurt, him.

If the characters seem hesitant, Volo reminds them that were it not for his starting them off on this adventure, they wouldn't have the gold in the first place.</li><li>Jelenn Urmbrusk, a Masked Lord in debt to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2NlZDg4MzUzMjUw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Manshoon</a>, requests an interest-free loan of 10,000 gp, which she vows to repay within a year. In exchange, she promises to use her “considerable influence with the Lords of Waterdeep” to help them in the future. If the characters oblige, she makes good on her promise to pay them back and grants them a special favor (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDJlNTk5MDA5ODAz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Marks of Prestige</a>”from the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>). If they refuse, they will have made an enemy of the secret Masked Lord.</li><li>Temples, charities, guilds, and down-on-their-luck strangers come knocking from time to time. What they ask for isn't much—a few gold here and there—but it all adds up.</li></ul><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Onward and Downward</span></h3><p>The characters should be 5th level by the end of this adventure. In the weeks that follow, word of their deeds spreads to every corner of Waterdeep. Finally, a note is delivered to them that reads as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Undermountain beckons. See you at the Yawning Portal.</p></blockquote><p>If the characters want to explore Undermountain, you can continue this campaign up through 20th level with the book <i>Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage</i>.<br></p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/004_-_Chapter_4_3A_Dragon_Season/004_-_Vault_of_Dragons/avatar.png"}

It connects to the subterranean town of Skullport by way of a long tunnel (area X4). A secret staircase (area X1) gives access to Waterdeep's sewers.<br></span><br>The lair has the following features, with exceptions noted in the text:<br><p></p><ul><li style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Unless noted otherwise, rooms are 20 feet high and hallways are 15 feet high.</span></li><li style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\">Rooms and corridors are brightly lit by <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZWIyNjY0MDNmM2Nm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>continual flame</a></i> spells cast on wall sconces.</li><li style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\">Most doors are single, circular slabs of stone, 8 feet in diameter and 6 inches thick, with stone hinges on one side. Double doors are 16-foot-wide, 8-foot-high semicircles that split open down the middle. Doorknobs are set into stone fixtures shaped like Xanathar's symbol. (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzMyNGExNTJhZjA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Xanathar</a> can open or close an unlocked door using its Telekinetic Ray, or obliterate a locked one with its Disintegration Ray.)</li></ul></p><hr><p><h3>Getting to the Lair<br></h3>Very few members of the Xanathar Guild have access to the beholder's secret lair.

Bregan D'aerthe knows that the safest route to the beholder's lair is a secret staircase in the sewers of the Castle Ward. Any character who belongs to this faction can get this information from Jarlaxle or another source.</p><p>If the party includes at least one Bregan D'aerthe member with renown of 4 or more in the faction, four male <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmIxMzgwZTgyODdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow</a></b> are waiting for the party at the top of the staircase. Their names are Arannis Nur'zekk, Beldar Tlabbath, Rylvar Tlabbath, and Draknafein Uriss. Their orders are to help the characters complete their mission, whatever the cost. These drow also have secret orders to kill <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmNiZTI1MmI3ZDNi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Nar'l Xibrindas</a>, if he's still alive, and retrieve Jarlaxle's <i>bag of holding</i> (see area X35).

Jeryth tells them that she has been sending awakened rats into the sewers to find the beholder's lair, and that they recently discovered a secret staircase in the Castle Ward sewers leading down to it (area X1). She has one of the<b> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGM1NDdkMTYzZjVi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>awakened rats</a>&nbsp;</b>lead them there.<br><br></p><h3>Zhentarim</h3>Characters who are members of the Zhentarim can approach <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTQwN2NjYjY4Zjlj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Yagra Stonefist</a></b> at the Yawning Portal. She recently learned about a “back door” to the beholder's lair from a drunken blabbermouth with ties to the Xanathar Guild. Yagra offers to lead them to a secret staircase in the sewers under the Castle Ward (area X1). “Trust me,” she says, “it's safer than the route through Undermountain and Skullport.”<p></p><p>Yagra will join their descent if the characters promise to pay her at least 1,000 gp. Otherwise, she wishes them well and heads back to the Yawning Portal.

The eyestalk can't be damaged but is destroyed by a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODY4Zjg3NjhmMDkw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>dispel magic</a></i> spell.

(Thorvin puts the coin he earns from the faction in a bank, far from the beholder's prying eyes.) If one or more characters approach him and claim to be Harpers, Thorvin is upset that they would risk exposing him as a spy, pointing to the albino gazer. If the characters befriend the gazer and promise to go away, Thorvin truthfully answers as many as three questions. He's never seen Ahmaergo's chambers (areas X11 and X12) but knows the rest of the lair well.<br><br>If the characters are looking for a way to mess with Xanathar's operation, Thorvin suggests they coerce <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmNiZTI1MmI3ZDNi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Nar'l Xibrindas</a>, the beholder's advisor (see area X18), into giving them the large supply of <i>smokepowder</i> that he smuggled into the dungeon.

One dwarf watches each location and communicates what it sees via the bronze bell. The scrying circle functions for no one else. It is suppressed within an <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZmNjMmUyNTdhMjY3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>antimagic field</a></i> and can also be dispelled (DC 17).

The lights fill a 10-foot cube in the middle of the room, and the beholder can throw its voice so that it seems to emanate from the same area.

If he sees intruders and the beholder isn't present, Ott draws his dagger and stammers, “You shouldn't be here! Stay back, or I'll call the boss!” Ott can't telepathically communicate with Xanathar, but he thinks he can. He closes his eyes and frantically asks for Xanathar to return to its sanctum and disintegrate the intruders.<br><br><b><i>Fishbowls. </i></b>Xanathar's pet fish, Sylgar, is the only creature that the beholder loves as much as itself. In fact, there have been many Sylgars over the years, but Ott is skilled at acquiring a replacement before Xanathar realizes its beloved pet has died.<br><br>Sylgar's large fishbowl weighs about 6,000 pounds, and the treasure chest at the bottom is real (see “Treasure” below). The small fishbowl weighs 60 pounds and is used primarily for feedings. Xanathar uses its telekinesis ray to transfer Sylgar from one fishbowl to another.<br><br><b><i>Mirror. </i></b>Carved into the mirror's frame is the word “Xoblob.” A <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Detect%20Magic#content\">detect magic</a></i> spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the mirror. Speaking the word “Xoblob” within 10 feet of the mirror causes its reflective surface to become a scrying sensor, showing the Old Xoblob Shop and the street in front of it, as seen through the eyes of the stuffed beholder that hangs in the shop's display window (see \"Old Xoblob Shop\" in A Friend In Need).<br><br><b><i>Spores. </i></b>The purple spores are infused with faerzress, a magical radiation found in the Underdark. A creature that ends its turn in the room must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer a random form of short-term madness, determined by rolling on the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDAzNGE3ZGI0NzFh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Short-Term Madness</a> table from the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>. A creature doesn't need to inhale the spores to be affected by them. Once the madness ends, the creature becomes immune to the spores in this room.<br><br><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> The treasure chest is unlocked and contains thirty 100 gp gemstones.

Standing in each alcove is a beholder-shaped copper urn atop a green marble pedestal. The lid of each urn is molded with ten eyestalks. (At the back of the westernmost alcove in the north wall is a secret door.)</li><li style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\">The western wall is carved to display a scowling beholder flanked by two hooded wizards.

If a cylinder is shattered, the fluid within it washes across the floor as the dead beholder lands with a wet plop and expels 1d4 baby gas spores that grow to full size in 30 days. Any character infected by these gas spores gains the following flaw until the disease is cured: “I hate other beholders. If I see a beholder, I must try to destroy it.”<br><br><b><i>Secret Door. </i></b>The secret door can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. It pulls open to reveal area X6 beyond.<br><br><b><i>Wall Carvings.</i></b> Any character who studies the carvings on the west wall and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that each wizard's eye is a button that can be pushed. If a character pushes either button, or uses an object or spell to do so, the beholder carving on the wall discharges a green ray that the character can dodge with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. If the ray hits, the character appears to be disintegrated but is actually teleported to area X34a or X34b, depending on which button was pushed. Once a button is pushed, it locks in place for 1 hour and can't be pushed again until that time elapses. A character can forcibly reset a button by making a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"></p><h4>X34. Wizard Tombs</h4>These crypts were built to hold the remains of two wizards who lived in this dungeon complex long before Xanathar took it over. Only one wizard is entombed here, however. The fate of the other wizard is unknown. Both chambers are encased in solid stone and brightly lit by <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZWIyNjY0MDNmM2Nm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>continual flame</a></i> spells cast on wall sconces.<p></p><p><b><i>X34a. </i></b>In the middle of this tomb rests a gold marble sarcophagus, its lid carved in the likeness of a long-haired human wizard who wears a robe adorned with closed eyes. The sarcophagus can't be pried open or damaged, but if a spell is cast within the tomb, the eyes of the robe open all at once—an eerie yet harmless effect—and the lid slowly levitates into the air, revealing the contents of the sarcophagus: a shriveled, inanimate mummy wearing <i>eyes of charming</i>. After 1 minute, the eyes on the lid close as it slowly sinks back down, resealing the sarcophagus until another spell is cast within the tomb.</p><p>A character who dons the <i>eyes of charming</i> can see, through its blue lenses, a blue metal tile shaped like a four-pointed star on the west wall. The tile is invisible otherwise, but can be found with a tactile search and a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check. When a creature touches the tile, all creatures in the tomb are instantly teleported to the arena (area X6).<br></p><p><b><i>X34b.</i></b> This tomb is empty except for an invisible, blue metal tile on the west wall.

These complexes have the following features:<br></span><p></p><ul><li style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Ceilings and doorways are 7 feet high.</span></li><li style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">There are no light sources.</span></li></ul><h3><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Areas of the Cellar Complex</span></h3><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The following locations are keyed to the Cellar Complex map. The complex has three distinct sections: the sewer tunnels (areas B1-B3), the southern cellars (areas B4-B9), and the northern cellars (areas B10-B11).<br></span><br><h4>B1. Sewer Access</h4>This chamber has stone steps and a locked, iron-bound wooden door with a sign mounted on it that reads, in Common, “SEWER ACCESS: AUTHORIZED CITY OFFICIALS ONLY.” The door to area B2 is locked. The lock can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. City Watch captains hold keys to sewer access points that correspond with their assigned wards.<p></p><hr><p></p><h4>B2. Sewers</h4>Fresh sewage flows along a trough that runs parallel to a stone walkway. The sewage is 3 feet deep. Any creature immersed in it for 1 minute must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with sewer plague.<br><br>Where the tunnel branches, a stone bridge spans the sewage pouring out of an eastern artery. There's no walkway in this arterial passage that leads to areas B3 and B4.<p></p><hr><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">B3. Secret Doors<br></span>Secret doors blend with the surrounding stonework on opposite sides of this sewer tunnel. One door opens into area B7, the other into area B10. Characters who have a passive Perception score of 15 or higher spot both secret doors as they pass by. Otherwise, finding a secret door requires a search of the wall and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The secret doors are set high enough that opening them doesn't cause sewage to flow into adjoining areas.</p><hr><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">B4. Rusty Iron Door<br></span>A door made of rusted iron is set into the wall above a dry, 1-foot-wide stone ledge. The door's lock corroded long ago, and the door squeals loudly on rusty hinges when opened.</p><hr><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">B5.

Sewer Access</h4><p>This chamber has stone steps and a locked, iron-bound wooden door with a sign mounted on it that reads, in Common, “SEWER ACCESS: AUTHORIZED CITY OFFICIALS ONLY.” The door to area B2 is locked. The lock can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. City Watch captains hold keys to sewer access points that correspond with their assigned wards.</p><p><br></p><p></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">B2. Sewers</h4><p>Fresh sewage flows along a trough that runs parallel to a stone walkway. The sewage is 3 feet deep. Any creature immersed in it for 1 minute must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with sewer plague from the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>.</p><p>Where the tunnel branches, a stone bridge spans the sewage pouring out of an eastern artery. There's no walkway in this arterial passage that leads to areas B3 and B4.</p><p></p><hr><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">B3. Secret Doors<br></span>Secret doors blend with the surrounding stonework on opposite sides of this sewer tunnel. One door opens into area B7, the other into area B10. Characters who have a passive Perception score of 15 or higher spot both secret doors as they pass by. Otherwise, finding a secret door requires a search of the wall and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The secret doors are set high enough that opening them doesn't cause sewage to flow into adjoining areas.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">B4.

Most of the ground floor is taken up by the tavern's common room, which contains a 40-foot-diameter open well (actually the outer shell of a sunken stone tower) that descends 140 feet to the first level of Undermountain, the sprawling dungeon under Waterdeep. A rope-and-pulley mechanism is used to lower adventurers into the well and hoist them out. More information about this entrance to Undermountain can be found in <i>Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage</i>.</p><p>The upper floors of the Yawning Portal contain comfortable, nicely appointed rooms for guests.</p><p>Durnan, the proprietor, charges standard prices for food, drink, and lodging (see chapter 5 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for costs).</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Familiar Faces</span></h3><p>Give the Yawning Portal Familiar Faces handout to the players, and allow each of them to select one NPC as a friendly acquaintance—someone the player's character knows and trusts.

To help the gang make ends meet, she works for Durnan as a barmaid.

He's called “Threestrings” because he plays a lute that has only three strings remaining. His secret is that he's a Harper spy, and he's far more eloquent and composed than he lets on. He lives at the inn, where he spends his afternoons and evenings spying on Zhentarim agents and gathering information on other potential troublemakers. He recently befriended Bonnie and wants to help her doppelganger gang settle into the city.</p><h4><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDUxYjE4ZjIxMjc3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Jalester Silvermane</a></h4><p><i>LG male Chondathan human fighter<br></i><b>Jalester Silvermane</b>&nbsp;is an agent of the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTdkMTk2ZjhjODU4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Lords' Alliance</a> who reports directly to Laeral Silverhand. The Open Lord of Waterdeep has asked him to spy on adventurers who might, through their actions, aid or imperil the city and its citizens. Since the Yawning Portal attracts adventurers of all sorts, Jalester spends a lot of time here, usually seated by himself in a quiet corner. Durnan knows that Jalester works for Laeral and leaves the young man alone.</p><p>Jalester is often distracted by thoughts of Faerrel Dunblade, his boyfriend, who was killed in a street fight last year.

Determine their marching order, then read the following text once they reach the alley's midpoint:</p><blockquote><p>A cart laden with apples comes careening toward you from the opposite direction, rolling downhill. Riding on the cart is a tiefling boy with an eye patch, screaming at the top of his lungs. “Look out!” he shouts.</p></blockquote><p>A character in the path of the apple cart must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be struck for 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage and knocked prone. A character can forgo the Dexterity saving throw and try to stop the cart bodily, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the character is struck by the cart and falls prone as it continues to roll. After plowing through the party, the cart flips on its side, sending apples tumbling down the alley. The tiefling boy is thrown from the cart but not seriously hurt.</p><p>The boy is one of three street urchins who teamed up to steal the apple cart from a nearby street corner. The other two children lost control of the cart at the crest of the alley before they could hop on. They catch up to their friend after the crash, make sure he's all right, and then apologize profusely to anyone who was hurt. The urchins, harmless troublemakers, are detailed in the handout “The Three Urchins.”</p><p>If they are asked about Fenerus, the children know who he is. They describe him as a big man with graying hair who looks like he has been in many fights, based on “the scars he wears on his face.” They know nothing more about him, other than that he lives alone.</p><p>If the characters don't frighten them away, the children loiter around the alley, eating apples and picking through garbage piles.</p><p><br></p><h4>Fenerus's House</h4><p>The door to Fenerus's house stands open, and the place has been ransacked. Painted in blood on the kitchen wall is a circle with ten equidistant lines radiating outward from its circumference: the sign of Xanathar. A thorough search accompanied by a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals small pools of blood on the kitchen floor. A successful check also verifies that the blood on the floor and wall is fresh.</p><p><br></p><h4>Fenerus's Story</h4><p>Fenerus Stormcastle was the founder of the Blood Hawk Posse, a gang of horse-riding brigands that, to this day, harries travelers on the road to Amphail. When he was drummed out of the gang after a botched raid, Fenerus “retired” to Waterdeep and joined the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters.</p><p>Until recently, Fenerus supplemented his income by spying for the city of Luskan and providing his contacts with information on the political climate in Waterdeep, as well as juicy bits of news overheard on his nightly rounds through the Trades Ward. He has no clue that his contacts are drow members of Bregan D'aerthe, since they wear cloaks and keep to the shadows.</p><p>Agents of the Lords' Alliance recently labeled Fenerus as a wanted brigand and notified the Lords of Waterdeep, who sent the City Watch to arrest him. Fenerus had the good sense to hide the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> elsewhere and hopes to use it as leverage to gain his freedom as well as forgiveness for past crimes.</p><p>Shortly after Fenerus's arrest, drow agents of Bregan D'aerthe showed up to collect the stone and were waylaid by invisible duergar hiding in the alley. The duergar were members of the Xanathar Guild that had been sent by Nar'l Xibrindas to retrieve the stone. After searching Fenerus's home and finding nothing, they were waiting for Fenerus to return when the drow showed up. The drow barely got away with their lives.</p><p><br></p><h4>Jarlaxle in Disguise</h4><p>Before the characters leave the alley, <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkMzA3NzY2ZmMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jarlaxle Baenre</a></b> uses his hat of disguise to approach them in the guise of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWM1M2NkZmE0YmI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Laeral Silverhand</a>, the Open Lord of Waterdeep:</p><blockquote><p>A tall, graceful woman in an emerald green cloak approaches you, her long, silver hair billowing out from under her hood. “If you've come looking for Fenerus Stormcastle, I'm afraid you're too late,” she says. “It appears Xanathar has gotten to him first. Fenerus had something in his possession that I desire. Perhaps you can help retrieve it.”</p></blockquote><p>“Laeral” tells the characters that Fenerus had a sentient magic item in his possession called the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>, which knows the location of a large cache of gold that was embezzled from the city by its previous Open Lord. She asks the characters to retrieve the stone, for the good of Waterdeep, and deliver it to her at the Seven Masks Theater in the Dock Ward. “Laeral” offers no reward other than the gratitude of Waterdeep's Open Lord.</p><p>Jarlaxle suspects that Nar'l Xibrindas, his spy in the Xanathar Guild, has betrayed him and is now using the resources of Bregan D'aerthe to help the beholder retrieve the stone. Jarlaxle also knows that the Xanathar Guild has a refuge fairly close by, in a cellar complex under the Southern Ward. “Laeral” suggests that the characters search for the stone there. (Jarlaxle doesn't want Nar'l to know that he's onto him, which is why he would rather send a small group of adventurers than call upon a Bregan D'aerthe attack force.)</p><p>Characters who are suspicious of Laeral's intentions can ascertain that she's hiding something with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by Jarlaxle's Charisma (Deception) check.

The submarine's structural integrity fails when the vessel drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it floods and sinks. The submarine is worth 15,000 gp intact and requires at least one pilot and one engineer to operate. It has a maximum speed of 2 miles per hour and can hold up to 10 passengers plus 2 tons of cargo.</p><p>The submarine has the following general features:</p><ul><li>Interior spaces are unlit. (The drow and the gnomes rely on darkvision to see.)</li><li>All furnishings and features are bolted down.</li><li>Chambers are 8 feet high, with 6-foot-high passages and doorways connecting them.</li><li>Air magically circulates through a complex ventilation system and small metal grills set into the floors.</li><li>Doors are made of steel and have AC 19, 27 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A door's lock can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A door can be forced open by a character who succeeds on a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. Jarlaxle and the gnomes aboard the <i>Scarlet Marpenoth</i> have keys to all locked doors. All doors are airtight while closed.</li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Areas of the Scarlet Marpenoth</span><br></p><p>The following locations are keyed to the map above.</p><p><br></p><h4>U1. Entrance Hatch</h4><p>Characters descending from Zardoz Zord's cabin on the <i>Eyecatcher</i> (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTZlNWIyMGMyMWY4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area J30</a>) arrive in this chamber. From this side, the circular metal hatch is opened by turning its valve wheel. This area is magically pressurized to keep water from entering the <i>Scarlet Marpenoth</i> if the hatch is opened while the submarine isn't docked to the <i>Eyecatcher</i>. But if both the outer hatch and the inner door are opened underwater, the submarine will flood.</p><p><br></p><h4>U2. Engine Room</h4><p>The door to this area is locked. A plaque on the door reads “ENGINE ROOM” in Common and Gnomish. The room has the following features:</p><ul><li>The engine room is filled with machines that hiss, whir, and clatter constantly. A rock gnome named Breena Bafflestone monitors the machinery at all times. Nearby is a copper speaking tube, which enables her to communicate with the control room command center (area U7b).</li><li>Drawers in the walls contain screwdrivers, wrenches, and other tools.</li><li>To port and starboard, 3-foot-high, 2½-foot-wide passageways lead deeper into the machinery. Medium creatures must squeeze to move through these passages.</li></ul><p><b><i>Machinery.</i></b> The engine is a quasi-magical machine that controls the submarine's propulsion and depth and powers the fins and rudder that control direction. A <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NGViNGI3MTJmYzQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect magic</a></i> spell or similar magic reveals an aura of transmutation magic throughout the area.</p><p>A character who has proficiency with tinker's tools can use the tools to disable the engine with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check. The same check reactivates the disabled engine. Whether it succeeds or fails, each check represents 10 minutes of work. The engine can also be destroyed. It has AC 16, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p><p><br></p><h4>U3. Soluun's Stateroom</h4><p>If he has not been encountered and disposed of elsewhere, a drow gunslinger named <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjlkNzNjNWM5ZTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Soluun Xibrindas</a></b> is here, worshiping before a shrine of Lolth. His stateroom has the following features:</p><ul><li>The port alcove contains a net hammock and a steel footlocker.</li><li>A black metal shrine of Lolth covered in tiny spider statuettes stands against one wall. At its top is a sculpture of the demon goddess, with the head and upper body of a female drow and the lower body of a spider.</li><li>A Lantanese diving suit hangs in the closet to the south.</li></ul><p><b><i>Diving Suit.</i></b> This experimental device consists of a pressure-resistant padded suit, made of canvas with iron fittings and iron gauntlets. A fishbowl helmet attaches to the suit's collar and functions as a <i>cap of water breathing</i>.</p><p><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> The shrine weighs 50 pounds and is worth 125 gp as an art object. The footlocker contains a pouch holding 50 gp and a <i>potion of healing</i>. The potion's crystal flask, shaped like a spider, is worth 25 gp.</p><p><br></p><h4>U4. Jarlaxle's Stateroom</h4><p>The door to this tidy cabin is locked. The cabin contains the following features:</p><ul><li>The scent of lavender magically permeates the cabin. (The scent is created by magic and can be dispelled.)</li><li>A hammock is suspended in the starboard alcove. A <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NGViNGI3MTJmYzQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect magic</a></i> spell or similar magic reveals that the wall behind the hammock radiates an aura of transmutation magic.</li><li>Other furnishings include a tall harp with a stool nearby, a harpsichord with a matching bench, a freestanding mirror, and a large wooden trunk.</li></ul><p><b><i>Closet.</i></b> The locked closet aft of the cabin contains a wooden rack stocked with sixty bottles of wine. Each one is a rare vintage worth 25 gp.</p><p><b><i>Magic Window.</i></b> Touching the wall behind the hammock renders the wall transparent from this side, and touching it again makes this “window” go away. When the wall is transparent, creatures in the cabin can see out, but creatures outside the submarine can't see in.</p><p>Wooden Trunk. The trunk isn't locked. Lifting the lid causes panels in the front and sides to open, releasing a swarm of mechanical spiders that attacks anyone other than Jarlaxle. This swarm has the statistics of a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDFiYWYxYjBjZTQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swarm of mechanical spiders</a></b>.</p><p>The chest has a secret compartment in the bottom that can be detected and opened with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If Jarlaxle has the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>, he keeps it in the secret compartment, along with any magic items he might have claimed from the characters. The compartment is otherwise empty.</p><p><br></p><h4>U5. Fel'rekt's Stateroom</h4><p>If he has not been encountered and defeated elsewhere, a drow gunslinger named <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTJiNGJlNTc2MjQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Fel'rekt Lafeen</a>&nbsp;</b>is here, cleaning his pistol. His stateroom contains a net hammock and a steel footlocker.</p><p><b><i>Treasure.</i></b> Fel'rekt's footlocker contains 65 gp in a pouch, a comb carved from dragon bone (worth 5 gp), and a pair of obsidian dice (worth 25 gp).</p><p><br></p><h4>U6. Krebbyg's Stateroom</h4><p>If he has not been encountered and defeated elsewhere, a drow gunslinger named <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTBhNjQwNTY2MDFk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Krebbyg Masq'il'yr</a></b> is here, sharpening his sword. His stateroom contains a net hammock and nothing else.</p><p><br></p><h4>U7. Control Room</h4><p>The control room has two levels: an observation deck (U7a) and a command center (U7b), with two ladders running between levels. Two circular soundproof windows are embedded in the port and starboard bulkheads. The window panes are made of glassteel, a resilient metal magically rendered transparent. Curious <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTIwZmI4OTVjNGEz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>merfolk</a></b> who live in Deepwater Harbor investigate the submarine from time to time, and might be seen peering through the windows.</p><p><b><i>U7a. Observation Deck.</i></b> If <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkMzA3NzY2ZmMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jarlaxle Baenre</a></b> is forced to retreat to the submarine, he is here when the characters first arrive. The observation deck is an elevated, 10-foot-high metal platform with a grilled floor, supported by two metal columns. Two padded swivel chairs are bolted to the deck, which is enclosed by a thin steel railing. The height of each chair can be adjusted to accommodate a Small or Medium creature. Between the two chairs is a bronze periscope that can be raised or lowered whenever the submarine is detached from the <i>Eyecatcher</i>.</p><p><b><i>U7b. Command Center.</i></b> Three <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDM4ZWJhYzEyZjc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>rock gnome engineers</a> named Lorella Middenpump, Tervaround Waggletop, and Anverth Leffery are on duty here, along with two <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTk1ODRlNTdjN2Qw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow elite warriors</a></b> named Karabal L'enz and Marro Qaz'arrt. The drow guard the control room and keep the gnomes on task.</p><p>Lorella sits in the pilot's swivel chair, which is bolted to the floor and can be lowered or raised to accommodate a Small or Medium creature. The chair is situated before a panel of dials, levers, and buttons. Tervaround and Anverth stand by the back wall, monitoring gauges and performing system checks. A copper speaking tube enables them to communicate with Breena Baffle­stone in the engine room (area U2).</p><p>The gnomes can pilot the <i>Scarlet Marpenoth</i> without needing to make a check. Any other creature must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence check to figure out the controls. From the control panel, the pilot can detach the submarine from the <i>Eyecatcher</i>, as well as control its speed, direction, and depth. The pilot can electrify the outer hull for 1 minute, after which the system requires 1 hour to recharge. Any creature that comes into contact with or starts its turn in contact with the outer hull when it's electrified must make a DC 15 Dexterity check, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature wearing metal armor has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p><p><br></p><h4>U8. Engineers' Staterooms</h4><p>Each of these four compartments contains an off-duty <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDM4ZWJhYzEyZjc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>rock gnome engineer</a> sleeping in a small hammock, beneath which are two steel footlockers. The four rock gnomes are named Cockaby Fapplestamp, Ellywick Fiddlefen, Gerbo Reese, and Zaffrab Horcusporcus.</p><p><b><i>Footlockers.</i></b> Each footlocker belongs to a particular gnome engineer stationed aboard the <i>Scarlet Marpenoth</i>. Both contain folded clothes sized for a gnome. One of them also holds a set of grease-stained overalls and a set of tinker's tools that belong to the gnome asleep in the bunk. There is a 25 percent chance that a footlocker also contains a clockwork toy, a fire starter, or a music box (as described in “Rock Gnome Tinkering” from the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</p><p><br></p><h4>U9. Dining Room</h4><p>This room has the following features:</p><ul><li>A walnut dining table is surrounded by eight padded swivel chairs. The height of each chair can be adjusted to accommodate a Small or Medium creature.</li><li>Soft, ambient music fills the room, created by magic.</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>U10. Galley</h4><p>This room has the following features:</p><ul><li>An iron stove sits in one corner.</li><li>In the opposite corner stands a steel food preparation table with utensils dangling above it. Built into the table is a lidded steel box attached to a pedal on the floor below. When the pedal is pumped, water and moving brushes scrub dishes and utensils that have been placed into the box.</li><li>A cart holds cutlery and dishes.</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>U11. Pantry</h4><p>Metal shelves lining the walls hold fresh fruit, vegetables, casks of wine, and meat. Two steel barrels (one containing ale, the other drinking water) stand beneath the shelves.</p><p><br></p><h4>U12. Privy</h4><p>This privy has a toilet and a washbasin, both attached to pipes. Above the basin is a hinged mirror, behind which is a compartment containing soap and towels.</p><p><br></p><h4>U13. Air System</h4><p>The door to this area is locked. A plaque on this door reads “AIR SYSTEM” in Common and Gnomish. The room has the following features:</p><ul><li>The area is filled with machines that hiss, whir, and clatter constantly.</li><li>Drawers in the walls contain screwdrivers, wrenches, and other tools.</li><li>To port and starboard, 3-foot-high, 2½-foot-wide passageways lead deeper into the machinery. Creatures that are Medium or larger must squeeze to move through these passages.</li></ul><p><b><i>Machinery.</i></b> The quasi-magical machinery in this area generates and circulates fresh air throughout the submarine. A <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NGViNGI3MTJmYzQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect magic</a></i> spell or similar magic reveals an aura of conjuration magic throughout the area.</p><p>A character who has proficiency with tinker's tools can use them to disable the machinery with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check. The same check reactivates the disabled machinery. Whether it succeeds or fails, each check represents 10 minutes of work. The machinery can also be destroyed. It has AC 16, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p><p>When this machinery shuts down, air stops pumping throughout the vessel. Unless the air system is reactivated, creatures trapped in the submarine that need oxygen to breathe will begin to suffocate after two days (see “Suffocating” rules).</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/013_-_Dragon_Heist_3A_Autumn_Adventure/001_-_Chapter_7_3A_Maestro_27s_Fall/003_-_Scarlet_Marpenoth/avatar.png"}

The two <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkM2E1NjA1ZmRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow gunslingers</a></b>&nbsp;lurk behind the <i>Kraken's Folly</i> (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Zjg4YTFlMDMyYjBh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area D1</a>) and wait to be rescued. When the characters confront them, Fel'rekt and Krebbyg stall for time until their escape vehicle arrives. If either drow falls, the other tosses the stone into the harbor to keep it from falling into enemy hands. A character can recover the sunken stone by using a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZDcyMzJkNjc4ZWRi ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect magic</a></i> spell to help pinpoint its location.</p><p><br></p><h4>Big Belchy</h4><p>A mechanical dragon turtle, dubbed Big Belchy, sank in Deepwater Harbor almost a century ago. Lantanese gnomes working for Jarlaxle have managed to repair the construct. Two rounds after the characters corner Fel'rekt and Krebbyg, Big Belchy surfaces next to the dock on initiative count 5, close enough that the drow can leap onto its barnacle-encrusted back on their next turns.</p><p>In the round after it surfaces, the mechanism breathes a cloud of steam onto the docks in a 30-foot cube, then begins to move away at a swimming speed of 20 feet. Any creature in the cloud of steam must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Big Belchy can breathe steam only once. On each of its turns thereafter, it swims a total of 40 feet toward Jarlaxle's flagship, the <i>Eyecatcher</i>, which is anchored in the middle of the harbor 1 mile away.</p><p>Big Belchy has AC 18, 75 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, it sinks once more to the bottom of Deepwater Harbor. If the drow are still on its back when it goes down, they swim the rest of the way to the <i>Eyecatcher</i> but gain two levels of exhaustion from the cold water and exertion.</p><p>If the drow are defeated while on Big Belchy's back, the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> tumbles off the mechanical dragon turtle's shell and drops into Deepwater Harbor.

If the characters don't take the hint, it writes not-so-subtle warnings (such as “Closing time!” and “Last call!”) on dusty floors and grimy windows. To truly claim the tavern as their own, the characters must either appease the poltergeist or destroy it.</p><p><b><i>Appeasing Lif.</i></b>&nbsp;If the characters work to repair and renovate the tavern with the goal of opening it to the public again, the poltergeist begins to accept them as the new owners and gradually becomes quite accommodating: pulling out a chair when a character wants to sit down, pouring a beer and delivering it to a character, taking coats when folks come in from the rain, and so forth. Once the business is up and running, Lif can also perform other helpful functions, such as locking doors, sweeping floors, and so forth.</p><p><b><i>Destroying Lif.</i></b>&nbsp;Lif's poltergeist is destroyed if its hit points are reduced to 0. If attacked, it flees to the uppermost level of the turret when reduced to half its hit points. From there it fights to the bitter end.</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/002_-_Chapter_2_3A_Trollskull_Alley/001_-_Trollskull_Manor/avatar.png"}

Even members of the Zhentarim who have no known criminal ties are rounded up and interrogated, including <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTczYTRiZTk0ZDM2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Davil Starsong</a>. Characters who are members of the faction are safe for the time being, as long as they keep a low profile. Otherwise, they too are rounded up and questioned over a period of several days, until the Lords of Waterdeep ascertain their level of involvement in the violence at Gralhund Villa. The broadsheets jump on the bandwagon by portraying the Black Network in the most unflattering light, thus dealing a crippling blow to the faction's already questionable reputation.</p><h4>Encounter with Istrid Horn</h4><p>This encounter occurs only if the characters were directly involved in the events that transpired at Gralhund Villa. After Davil Starsong is taken in for questioning, <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDI0OGJlYjdlMzI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Istrid Horn</a></b>&nbsp;sends a message to the characters by way of a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YWRlYjJiZTUyZTBh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>flying snake</a></b>. The message, written in Common, reads as follows:</p><blockquote><p>I would like to know more about what happened at Gralhund Villa. If you can spare the time, meet me at Ahghairon's Statue in the City of the Dead at highsun tomorrow. You'll be paid generously for your time and trouble.<br>—Istrid Horn&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>If the characters attend the meeting, use the following boxed text to help set the scene, embellishing it to reflect the season:<br></p><blockquote><p>Ahghairon's Statue is a well-known landmark in the city's parkland cemetery: a tall, marble sculpture of a bearded, robed wizard standing atop concentric steps and facing west toward the skyline of Waterdeep, his hands outstretched and a broad smile on his face. At the foot of the statue stands a female dwarf clad in plate armor.</p></blockquote><p>If the weather is fair, characters can see pedestrians, picnickers, and frolicking children throughout the cemetery grounds. It's clear that Istrid chose a safe, public place for the meeting. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check can tell that she came alone.<br></p><p>Istrid fears being arrested by the City Watch. Although she wasn't involved in the matters concerning Gralhund Villa, she is worried that the Watch will uncover her illegal currency-lending operation in the course of its investigations. She offers the characters 10 pp just for meeting with her and promises another 40 pp if the characters agree to help her lie low for a tenday—half to be paid once a deal is struck and half at the end of her stay. If they decline her offer and the party includes one or more Zhentarim members, she threatens that if she's arrested and charged with a crime, she will reveal their affiliation and bring them down with her.</p><p><b><i>Hiding Istrid.</i></b> If the characters decide to let Istrid hide out at their tavern, she uses a disguise kit to make herself up to be a male dwarf named Jorn. If asked to do so, she's willing to perform chores around the place once she settles in. Ultimately, no one comes looking for her, but the longer she stays hidden, the more testy and demanding she becomes.</p><p>If the characters tolerate her bad behavior, Istrid leaves at the end of the tenday as promised and pays characters the remainder of what she owes. Characters who are members of the Zhentarim gain an added benefit for harboring Istrid in her time of need: their renown in the faction increases by 2.</p><p>If, on the other hand, the characters throw her out or rat her out to the City Watch, Istrid becomes their mortal enemy and tries to undermine them at every turn.</p><p><b><i>Harming Istrid.</i></b> As a precaution against being double-crossed, Istrid shared her plan concerning the characters with at least one other member of the Doom Raiders (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDBkZmExNzM3Yzg4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Skeemo Weirdbottle</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODk1MGQ3ZjBmZWQw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tashlyn Yafeera</a>, or <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDI3MzRjNGM5OTAw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ziraj the Hunter</a>). If the characters betray or harm Istrid, her former adventuring companions use every resource at their disposal to ruin the characters.

Members of Bregan D'aerthe follow them invisibly. Superstitious locals think the tower is haunted, so they avoid it.</p><p><br></p><h4>Antimagic Field</h4><p>The interior of the tower is subject to a permanent <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZmNjMmUyNTdhMjY3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>antimagic field</a></i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/\"> </a>spell. Consequently, no magic functions inside the tower. This effect was left behind by the tower's previous occupant, a wizard hermit who dabbled in “wild magic” and could no longer control it. Because of the antimagic field, the magic lights that normally illuminate the tower have been suppressed. Only a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MDM1YmRiNzgzM2Zl ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>wish</a></i> spell or similar magic can end this antimagic effect.</p><p><br></p><h4>Tower Swords</h4><p>Scattered on the floors throughout the tower are six longswords with no traces of rust or blood on them. These blades are <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTA2ZGRjZWM1NzA0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>flying swords</a></b> rendered inert by the antimagic field. If a flying sword is taken from the tower, it animates and attacks.</p><p><br></p><h4>Where's the Stone?</h4><p>Fenerus hid the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> in the cauldron that hangs in the fireplace on the upper level (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTIxYzRjMDY0M2U5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area O3</a>). But it's not there anymore.</p><p>Before the characters reach area O3, three <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkM2E1NjA1ZmRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow gunslingers</a></b>&nbsp;under the effect of <i>potions of invisibility</i> use their <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YjNjNDNhNTY1NzE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>levitate</a></i> spells to scale the outside of the tower and crawl through the arrow slits. While they are inside the tower, their <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Y2I5NGY5M2Y0MTky ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>invisibility</a></i> spells are negated by the antimagic field. One of the drow quickly finds the stone and takes it before the characters show up.</p><p>Unless they were defeated earlier in the adventure, these drow are Jarlaxle's lieutenants: <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTJiNGJlNTc2MjQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Fel'rekt Lafeen</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTBhNjQwNTY2MDFk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Krebbyg Masq'il'yr</a>, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjlkNzNjNWM5ZTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Soluun Xibrindas</a>. Replace any that were killed earlier in the adventure with other <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkM2E1NjA1ZmRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>drow gunslingers</a></b>, and roll initiative for each drow. Soluun (or his replacement) can't resist a good fight and attacks the characters, buying time for the other drow to escape. Once they're outside the tower, the fleeing drow become invisible again as they leap onto a nearby rooftop, but the potions wear off at the end of their next turns, enabling characters to chase after them.</p><p><br></p><h4>Next Encounter</h4><p>If the characters pursue the fleeing drow, proceed with encounter 5, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2U2Y2IxOTFjNTky ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Rooftop Chase</a>.”</p></section>","img":""}

Their adventures often earn them fame and power, allies and enemies, and titles that they can pass on to their descendants. Some lords and ladies began as commoners who ventured into the dangerous places of the world and made names for themselves through their brave deeds.</p><p>This section details the most common marks of prestige that adventures might acquire during a campaign. These marks are usually gained along with treasure, but sometimes they stand on their own.<br></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Letters of Recommendation</h4><p>When gold is in short supply, the adventurers’ benefactor might provide them with a letter of recommendation instead of monetary payment. Such a letter is usually enclosed in a handsome folio, case, or scroll tube for safe transport, and it usually bears the signature and seal of whoever wrote it.</p><p>A letter of recommendation from a person of impeccable reputation can grant adventurers access to NPCs that they would otherwise have trouble meeting on their own, such as a duke, viceroy, or queen. Moreover, carrying such a recommendation on one’s person can help clear up “misunderstandings” with local authorities who might not otherwise take the adventurers at their word.</p><p>A letter of recommendation is worth only as much as the person who wrote it and offers no benefit in places where its writer holds no sway.</p><h4>Medals</h4><p>Although they are often fashioned from gold and other precious materials, medals have an even greater symbolic value to those who award and receive them.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Medals are typically awarded by powerful political figures for acts of heroism, and wearing a medal is usually enough to earn the respect of those who understand its significance.</p><p>Different acts of heroism can warrant different kinds of medals. The King of Breland (in the Eberron campaign setting) might award a Royal Badge of Valor (shaped like a shield and made of ruby and electrum) to adventurers for defending Brelish citizens, while the Golden Bear of Breland (a medal made of gold and shaped in a likeness of a bear's head, with gems for eyes) might be reserved for adventurers who prove their allegiance to the Brelish Crown by uncovering and defeating a plot to end the Treaty of Thronehold and reignite the Last War.</p><p>A medal doesn't offer a specific in-game benefit to one who wears it, but it can affect dealings with NPCs. For example, a character who proudly displays the Golden Bear of Breland will be regarded as a hero of the people within the kingdom of Breland. Outside Breland, the medal carries far less weight, except among allies of Breland's king.</p><h4>Parcels of Land</h4><p>A parcel of land is just that, and usually comes with a royal letter affirming that the land has been granted as a reward for some service. Such land usually remains the property of the local ruler or ruling body, but is leased to a character with the understanding that it can be taken away, especially if his or her loyalty is ever called into question.</p><p>A parcel of land, if sufficiently large, might have one or more farms or villages on it already, in which case the recipient is pronounced lord or lady of the land and is expected to collect taxes, along with any other duties. </p><p>A character who receives a parcel of land is free to build on it and is expected to safeguard it. He or she may yield the land as part of an inheritance, but can't sell or trade it without permission from the local ruler or ruling body.</p><p>Parcels of land make fine rewards for adventurers who are looking for a place to settle or who have family or some kind of personal investment in the region where the land is located.</p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Special Favors</h4><p>A reward might come in the form of a favor that the characters can call on at some future date. Special favors work best when the individual granting them is trustworthy. A lawful good or lawful neutral NPC will do whatever can be done to fulfill an obligation when the time comes, short of breaking laws. A lawful evil NPC does the same, but only because a deal is a deal. A neutral good or neutral PC might pay off favors to protect his or her reputation. A chaotic good NPC is more concerned about doing right by the adventurers, honoring any obligations without worrying too much about personal risk or adherence to the law.<br></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Special Rights</h4><p>A politically powerful person can reward characters by giving them special rights, which are usually articulated in some sort of official document. For example, characters might be granted special rights to carry weapons in public places, kill enemies of the crown, or negotiate on a duke's behalf. They might earn the right to demand free room and board from any establishment within a particular community, or have the right to draft local militia to assist them as needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Special rights last only as long as the legal document dictates, and such rights can be revoked if the adventurers abuse them.<br></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Strongholds</h4><p>A stronghold is a reward usually given to seasoned adventurers who demonstrate unwavering fealty to a powerful political figure or ruling body, such as a king, a knighthood, or a council of wizards. A stronghold can be anything from a fortified tower in the heart of a city to a provincial keep on the borderlands. While the stronghold is for the characters to govern as they see fit, the land on which it sits remains the property of the crown or local ruler. Should the characters prove disloyal or unworthy of the gift, they can be asked or forced to relinquish custody of the stronghold.</p><p>As an additional reward, the individual bequeathing the stronghold might offer to pay its maintenance cost for a period of one or more months, after which the characters inherit that responsibility. See chapter 6 of the&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>&nbsp;for more information on stronghold maintenance.<br></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Titles</h4><p>A politically powerful figure has the ability to dispense titles. A title often comes with a parcel of land (see above). For example, a character might be awarded the title Earl of Storm river or Countess of Dun Fjord, along with a parcel of land that includes a settlement or region of the same name.</p><p>A character can hold more than one title, and in a feudal society, those titles can be passed down to (or distributed among) one's children. While a character holds a title, he or she is expected to act in a manner befitting that title. By decree, titles can be stripped away if the local ruler or ruling body has reason to question the character's loyalty or competence.<br></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Training</h4><p>A character might be offered special training in lieu of a financial reward. This kind of training isn't widely available and thus is highly desirable. It presumes the existence of a skilled trainer-perhaps a retired adventurer or champion who is willing to serve as a mentor. The trainer might be a reclusive wizard or haughty sorcerer who owes the queen a favor, the knight-commander of the King's Guard, the leader of a powerful druid circle, a quirky monk who lives in a remote mountaintop pagoda, a barbarian chieftain, a warlock living among nomads as a fortune-teller, or an absentminded bard whose plays and poetry are known throughout the land.</p><p>A character who agrees to training as a reward must spend downtime with the trainer (see chapter 6 of the&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>&nbsp;for more information on downtime activities). In exchange, the character is guaranteed to receive a special benefit. Possible training benefits include the following:<br></p><ul><li>The character gains inspiration daily at dawn for 1d4+6 days.</li><li>The character gains proficiency in a skill.</li><li>The character gains a feat.</li></ul></section>","img":""}

He has spent the past several months scouring wrecks at the bottom of the harbor for treasure and stashing precious baubles in a hidden underwater cave. Recently, he noticed a strange craft mounted on the underside of the <i>Eyecatcher</i>. His attempts to treat with the crew have met with no success, but he's curious to know more. Since the characters appear to be headed toward a rendezvous with the <i>Eyecatcher</i>, Zelifarn would like them to find out all they can about the underwater vessel without raising suspicion. The dragon promises to meet them again after they have completed their mission. In exchange for information, he offers to give the party a barnacle-covered chest that he found recently. He hasn't opened it yet, so its contents are unknown to him, but he can smell gold inside.</p><p><br></p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>Zelifarn approaches the characters again as they leave the <i>Eyecatcher</i>.

She reached out to him with a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Mjk0OGViOTEyZjIx ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>sending</a></i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/\"> </a>spell to arrange this meeting, in the hope of finding out his plans. The characters can follow the drow spies to the rendezvous. If the drow realize they're being followed, they make no effort to shake their pursuers. If they're attacked, they scatter and try to complete their mission before heading back to the <i>Eyecatcher</i>.</p><p>If a battle erupts and escape appears impossible, the drow fight to the death. A City Watch patrol consisting of six <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veterans</a></b> arrives 1d4 minutes later to make arrests.</p><p><br></p><h4>Jarlaxle's Letter</h4><p>One of the Bregan D'aerthe spies carries a letter for Laeral. It bears the wax seal of Luskan and is written in Jarlaxle's elegant hand, in Elvish. It reads as follows:</p><blockquote><p>To Her Ageless Majesty, Laeral Silverhand, the Witch-Queen of Stornanter, Lady of the North, She of the Seven Sisters, Chosen of Mystra, and Open Lord of Waterdeep:</p><p>Your spies are to be commended! Rest assured, my presence in your fair city is purely recreational—though if fortune smiles upon me, this visit could benefit us both.</p><p>Your predecessor left the City of Splendors in a sorry state, but you have done wonders to lift the spirit of the citizenry during your short time in office. I know how politics offends you, so forgive me for taking this opportunity to point out the obvious. We can make both our cities stronger and strike back at he who robbed Waterdavians of their wealth and dignity. I'm speaking, of course, of that dirty sack of rats, Dagult Neverember. That's the phrase you used to describe him yesterday to the emissary from Mirabar, is it not? Evidently, my spies are also to be commended!<br></p><p>Why let Neverember get away with his crimes against Luskan and Waterdeep? Can we be allies, if not friends? These are the questions that haunt my dreams, as surely as I haunt yours.<br></p><p>Sincerely,<br>J</p></blockquote><p>Laeral isn't surprised that Jarlaxle lacks the courage to meet her in person. She thanks the drow messengers for delivering the letter, cautions them to mind the City Watch and the City Guard, and heads back to the Palace of Waterdeep. The drow spies return whence they came.<br></p><p><br></p><h4>Conversation with Laeral</h4><p>If Laeral becomes aware of the characters, she appears before them and asks what business they have with Bregan D'aerthe. If the characters have not met the Open Lord before, she might impress them with her plain­spoken manner and lack of pretense. Alone and outside the political maelstrom, she acts more like an adventurer than a city official.</p><p>If the characters inquire about the letter, she shows it to them and asks their opinions on Luskan's joining the Lords' Alliance. In her mind, Luskan is a greedy pirate state that can't be trusted under any circumstances. If the characters feel similarly, she trusts them enough to ask for their help in finding and securing Lord Neverember's hidden cache of dragons. In exchange, she promises them a 5,000 gp reward and Waterdeep's gratitude.</p><hr><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Day of Wonders Parade</span><br></p><p>The Day of Wonders is the grandest parade of the fall season, and Jarlaxle wants the Sea Maidens Faire to be a part of it. In the guise of Zardoz Zord, he pays a visit the day before the holiday to the House of Inspired Hands, Waterdeep's temple of Gond, to coordinate with the acolytes in charge of organizing the parade. He pre­sents a detailed plan that commingles the attractions of the Sea Maidens Faire with the bizarre inventions of the temple—a plan that is well received.</p><p>The evening before the Day of Wonders, workers begin assembling the wagons and floats of the Sea Maidens Faire on the pier. Early the following morning, the docks are a hive of activity as performers practice their routines and caged creatures are offloaded one by one. An hour before highsun on this crisp and windy autumn day, the Sea Maidens Faire makes its way to the House of Inspired Hands to meet up with the Gond worshipers and their contraptions. From there, the parade strikes out in earnest, marching through Waterdeep's streets to the cheers of the local folk. Zardoz Zord serves as grand marshal, leading the parade on the back of a rainbow-feathered diatryma summoned using his <i>feather of diatryma summoning</i>. For Jarlaxle, the parade is a chance to show off and be cheered; he has no ulterior motive for participating in the event.</p><p><br></p><h4>While the Boss Is Away</h4><p>As the Sea Maidens Faire parades through Waterdeep, the characters can slip aboard one or more of Jarlaxle's ships. If things turns violent aboard a ship, its captain uses a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Mjk0OGViOTEyZjIx ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>sending</a></i> spell to contact Jarlaxle. Jarlaxle is supremely confident that his crews can overcome any threat, so he doesn't rush to their defense at the first sign of trouble. Only if the characters do considerable damage will he treat their attack as a setback.</p><p>If the characters escape a confrontation on the ships but leave behind witnesses who can identify them, it takes Bregan D'aerthe several days to track them down (assuming Jarlaxle hasn't already met them). Although killing the characters would be easy at that point, Jarlaxle would rather put them to work for him. He has them watched but doesn't provoke hostilities until such time as the reward clearly outweighs the risks.</p><hr><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Escaped Bear</span><br></p><p>The Sea Maidens Faire parade ends where it started—at the docks. As the attractions are being loaded back onto their ships, the Faire's <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzA4MDU3MDliOTlj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>polar bear</a></b> gets loose, fleeing into the Dock Ward before its handlers can corner it. News of the escaped bear spreads quickly, and sightings are frequent. If the characters impressed one of the drow ship captains, he contacts them by way of a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Mjk0OGViOTEyZjIx ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>sending</a></i> spell and asks for help. He wants the bear retrieved before the City Guard finds and kills it, offering a reward of either 250 gp or a <i>potion of water breathing</i>.</p><p>The characters can track and corner the polar bear with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check. Whether a check succeeds or fails, each attempt represents 1 hour of searching. If the characters find the bear within 4 hours, it can be lured back to the Sea Maidens Faire with food or a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. The captain then makes good on the promised reward. If the characters don't find the bear, members of the City Guard get to it first and kill it.</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/013_-_Dragon_Heist_3A_Autumn_Adventure/001_-_Chapter_7_3A_Maestro_27s_Fall/004_-_Special_Events/avatar.png"}

The trolls are fitted with eyeless helms and ball-and-chain shackles around their ankles. They are then set loose in different wards of the city during Trolltide. When the characters happen upon such a scene, read:</p><blockquote><p>Children in troll masks run through the fog and drizzle, knocking on doors and stopping adults in the streets. Those who aren't placated with candied apples, sticks of salted meat, and other treats perpetrate all manner of tricks. A grumpy old woman has a rat thrown in her face. A burly dwarf has his pipe pilfered.</p><p>A small crowd of onlookers is gathered around a ten-foot-tall wicker effigy of a troll, stamping their feet as two young men struggle to set the likeness ablaze with sputtering torches.</p><p>Suddenly a white-haired man bolts toward the crowd, his face a mask of terror. Behind him lurches a massive, green-skinned giant dragging a ball and chain across the cobbled street. A blind helm covers the troll's eyes, but its mouth is a veritable cavern of sharp teeth. The blinded troll<b>&nbsp;</b>flails its arms, slashing at the fog around it, and lets out a horrible wail of frustration. The crowd panics at the sight of it and flees into the mist and rain. Meanwhile, two members of the City Watch sneak up behind the blind troll, hoping to strike a mortal blow.</p></blockquote><p>The white-haired man is a Waterdavian noble of no real accomplishments named Bromas Sultlue. When he sees the characters, he shouts, “It's a troll! Do something!” If the characters intervene, the two City Watch <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veterans</a></b> fight alongside them. These constables act on the same initiative count.

As the characters battle the troll, children in troll masks bravely pelt the creature with candied apples.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">Development</span><br>If the characters contribute to the defeat of the troll, the City Watch is grateful. Bromas Sultlue congratulates them and spends the next tenday recounting every detail of the battle to friends and family members. The story of the characters' heroism spreads, and they gain many new patrons at their tavern. For the next six tendays, when determining the tavern's profitability, add 20 to rolls on the Running a Business table (see <u>\"Tavern Keeping Expenses\"</u> in <b>Open For Business?</b>). Thereafter, add 10 to such rolls to represent Waterdeep's lingering fondness for the “Trollslayers of Trollskull Alley.”</p><p></p><p></p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/010_-_Dragon_Heist_3A_Spring_Adventure/001_-_Chapter_5_3A_Spring_Madness/003_-_Special_Events/avatar.png"}

The characters have no trouble getting directions to her <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGU2ZWQ2Mjc0ZmZl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Mistshore</a> residence (area D2).<br></span><br>When the characters arrive at her home, <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDAwY2FmYjU4YzNm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Grinda Garloth</a></b> is holed up inside, having barricaded the doors with furniture. Trying to break down the doors are four members of the Xanathar Guild (CE male human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzAzZTRmMDczZTBj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bandits</a></b>) under the command of a dwarf enforcer named <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGI3Yzc4Zjc5YTU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Noska Ur'gray</a></b>. A <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjQxZGUxM2UwYzY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>merrow</a></b> also under Noska's command swims beneath the docks. It surfaces to attack when the characters arrive.<br><br>If the characters come to Grinda's defense, Noska orders his thugs to attack them while he takes potshots at the characters with his crossbow. Two rounds later, eight more bandits leap down from the&nbsp;Kraken's Folly (area D1) and join the fray. These hooligans were paid 1 gp each to watch Noska's back. The characters can turn them against Noska by offering a larger bribe (at least 5 gp each).<br><br>If the characters turn the hooligans against Noska or reduce the dwarf to half his hit points or fewer, Noska flees. Any remaining Xanathar Guild members cover his escape. Grinda emerges from her residence to thank the characters once the fight has concluded.<br><br><h4>Where's the Stone?</h4>Grinda admits that she has done business with the Xanathar Guild in the past. Her orders were to protect the stone until Noska arrived to claim it, but she changed her mind and decided to keep the stone for herself. She now realizes that decision was a mistake.<br><br>Grinda tells the characters that she gave the stone to her rat familiar and told the creature to stash it in her family's mausoleum in the City of the Dead. The mage gives the characters directions to the site and a key to the mausoleum. (They won't need the key, since the mausoleum is open when they arrive.)<br><br><h4>Spy in the Sky</h4>As the characters leave Mistshore, a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDk4ZTg3ZjFiYjJm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>gazer</a></b> begins to follow them, staying at least 60 feet away.

Faster creatures always catch up to slower ones, while creatures with the same speed never close the distance between each other. This set of rules can make chase more exciting by introducing random elements.</p><p><br></p><h3>Beginning A Chase</h3><p> A chase requires a quarry and at least one pursuer. Any participants not already in initiative order must roll initiative. As in combat, each participant in the chase can take one action and move on its turn. The chase ends when one side drops out or the quarry escapes. </p><p>When a chase begins, determine the starting distance between the quarry and the pursuers. Track the distance between them, and designate the pursuer closest to the quarry as the lead. The lead pursuer might change from round to round.</p><p><br></p><h3 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Running The Chase</h3><p>Participants in the chase are strongly motivated to use the Dash action every round. Pursuers who stop to cast spells and make attacks run the risk of losing their quarry, and a quarry that does so is likely to be caught.</p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Dashing</h4><p>During the chase, a participant can freely use the Dash action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution modifier. Each additional Dash action it takes during the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain one level of exhaustion.</p><p>A participant drops out of the chase if its exhaustion reaches level 5, since its speed becomes 0. A creature can remove the levels of exhaustion it gained during the chase by finishing a short or long rest.</p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Spells and Attacks</h4><p>A chase participant can make attacks and cast spells against other creatures within range. Apply the normal rules for cover, terrain, and so on to the attacks and spells.</p><p>Chase participants can't normally make opportunity attacks against each other, since they are all assumed to be moving in the same direction at the same time. However, participants can still be the target of opportunity attacks from creatures not participating in the chase. For example, adventurers who chase a thief past a gang of thugs in an alley might provoke opportunity attacks from the thugs.</p><p><br></p><h3>Ending A Chase</h3><p>A chase ends when one side or the other stops, when the quarry escapes, or when the pursuer are close enough to their quarry to catch it.</p><p>If neither side gives up the chase, the quarry makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check at the end of each round, after every participant in the chase has taken its turn. The result is compared to the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the pursuers. If the quarry consists of multiple creatures, they all make the check.</p><p>If the quarry is never out of the lead pursuer's sight, the check fails automatically. Otherwise, if the result of the quarry's check is greater than the highest passive score, that quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues for another round. </p><p>The quarry gains advantage or disadvantage on its check based on prevailing circumstances, as shown in the Escape Factors table. If one or more factors give the quarry both advantage and disadvantage on its check, the quarry has neither, as usual.</p><p><b>Escape Factors</b><br></p><table class=\"userscript-table userscript-table-bordered\"><thead><tr><th>Factor</th><th>Check Has...</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Quarry has many things to hide behind</td><td>Advantage</td></tr><tr><td>Quarry is in a very crowded or noisy area</td><td>Advantage</td></tr><tr><td>Quarry has few things to hide behind</td><td>Disadvantage</td></tr><tr><td>Quarry is in an uncrowded or quiet area</td><td>Disadvantage</td></tr><tr><td>The lead pursuer is a ranger or has proficiency in Survival</td><td>Disadvantage</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Other factors might help or hinder the quarry's ability to escape, at your discretion. For example, a quarry with a <i>faerie fire</i> spell cast on it might have disadvantage on checks made to escape because it's much easier to spot. </p><p>Escape doesn't necessarily mean the quarry has outpaced its pursuers. For example, in an urban setting, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a crowd or slipped around a corner, leaving no clue as to where it went.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Chase Complications</span><br></p>As with any good chase scene, complications can arise to make a chase more pulse-poumnding. The Urban Chase Complications table provides several examples.</p><p>Complications occur randomly. Each participant in the chaase rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. Consult the table to determine whether a complication occurs. If it does, it affects the next chase participant in the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant affected by the complication can spend inspiration to negate the complication.</p><p>Characters can create their own complications to shake off pursuers (for example, casting the web spell in a narrow alleyway). Adjudicate these as you see fit.</p><p><b>Urban Chase Complications</b><br><p></p><table class=\"userscript-table userscript-table-bordered\"><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align: center\">d20</th><th>Complication</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">1</td><td>A large obstacle such as a horse or cart blocks your way.

Jarlaxle is waiting for them at the Seven Masks Theater in the Dock Ward. The theater caters to a lower-class clientele, and ship captains and sailors are admitted for free. The owner of the theater is a burly and jovial Shou man with a braided goatee named Rongquan Mystere—another of Jarlaxle's many disguises. When Jarlaxle is away, he entrusts his stage managers to look after things.</p><p><br></p><h4>Sapphiria's Booty</h4><p>When the characters first arrive, all doors except the ones leading backstage are locked.

When a charming sea captain arrives with a hold full of booty from a faraway land, Sapphiria decides to steal it. Zaniness ensues when she falls in love with the first mate, who is half her age, while the captain falls in love with her. On one side of the stage is a backdrop resembling the deck of a ship; the other side is decorated to look like a madam's parlor in a brothel, complete with a gaudy chandelier and a fainting couch.</p><p>Westra Moltimmur (CG female Illuskan human <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRkYjY0MzJkMzlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></b> with Insight +2 and Performance +6), the play's leading lady, is one of Waterdeep's great treasures, and the cast and crew are very protective of her. Now in her seventies and having been married no fewer than seven times, she has a brisk sense of humor and a zest for life. She's also insightful enough to know that “Rongquan Mystere” isn't what he appears to be. She has seen the dark elves who watch over Rongquan and observed him using subtle hand gestures (Drow Sign Language) to communicate with them.</p><p><br></p><h4>Speaking with Rongquan</h4><p>Jarlaxle has instructed the stage managers to bring all visitors to him.

He also seems to know all about the characters' meeting with Laeral (see encounter 1, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjkwOGNkNzE4YjVm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Alley</a>”) and says he can speak on her behalf. He asks about the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> and is disappointed if the characters don't have it. If they offer up the fake stone recovered in encounter 9, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTg4ZGM0ODk2ZjQy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Cellar Complex</a>,” Rongquan immediately realizes it's a fake.</p><p>If the characters aren't sure what to do next, Jarlaxle imparts the following information:</p><blockquote><p>“My friends, don't be discouraged. The wind is blowing in our direction! I've learned that Fenerus Stormcastle was arrested by the City Watch for theft and taken to a courthouse in the Castle Ward to face the judgment of a magister. No doubt he hid the stone before his capture. You must speak to him right away. You'll need to devise some sort of ruse to get close to Fenerus. I urge against violence, or you might find yourself locked up beside him.”</p></blockquote><p>If the characters ask why <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWM1M2NkZmE0YmI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Laeral Silverhand</a> doesn't question Fenerus herself or bail him out of jail, Jarlaxle laughs and says it would be politically unwise for the Open Lord to be seen negotiating with a man who has committed heinous crimes against the city.<br></p><p>Jarlaxle could speak to Fenerus himself, but he's not sure if the courthouse is warded against magic. He can't risk the exposure, so he sends the characters instead. If the characters refuse to work for Rongquan, he shrugs his broad shoulders and lets them leave unmolested, figuring they'll try to talk to Fenerus anyway.</p><p>If the characters attack him, Jarlaxle smiles, whistles for his drow bodyguards, and has at them. If the characters fall in combat, Jarlaxle and his guards stabilize dying party members before dragging all of them to a snowy alley and leaving them there with their gear. After the drow depart, a cold wind tears through the alley and awakens the unconscious characters.</p><p><br></p><h4>Next Encounter</h4><p>If the characters decide to speak with Fenerus, proceed with encounter 8, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODIzMmY0OGFmN2Fk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Courthouse</a>.”</p></section>","img":""}

This book presents much of that information, but you aren't bound by it. Feel free to embellish and change what you will. Your version of Waterdeep is the only version that matters for your campaign.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 24px ; font-weight: bold\">Adventure Structure</span></h3><p><i>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</i> consists of an introductory adventure designed to familiarize player characters with the city of Waterdeep and provide them with a base of operations (chapters 1 and 2), followed by a citywide treasure hunt (chapters 3 and 4) and descriptions of the villains' lairs (chapters 5 through 8).</p><p>In <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWQ2MzBjYWVhMzgw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>chapter 1</a>, the characters arrive at the Yawning Portal, where Volo gives them a quest. It's a straightforward rescue mission with a twist involving a case of mistaken identity. If the adventurers complete the quest, Volo rewards them with a valuable piece of property.</p><p>In <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzU2ZGM5ODNiOTc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>chapter 2</a>, the characters explore their new home in Trollskull Alley and attract the attention of factions interested in recruiting them for special missions.</p><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZjcyZjM0OGYxMmUx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Chapter 3</a> begins days or weeks later, allowing characters time to adjust to city life and pursue their own interests. An explosion tears through Trollskull Alley, prompting an investigation that hurls the characters into conflict with some secondary villains, culminating in a bloody confrontation at a noble estate.</p><p>In <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWI4MDY3NmVmNDQy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>chapter 4</a>, the characters race to find the gold. The encounters in this chapter and the order in which they occur change depending on the villain you've chosen. The chapter concludes with the discovery of Lord Neverember's treasure vault and a showdown with its gold dragon guardian. The characters' ultimate goal is to prevent the gold from falling into the hands of the bad guys. If all goes well, some of the gold will find its way into the characters' pockets. Characters will have a hard time claiming it all for themselves, however.</p><p>Chapters 5 through 8 describe the lairs of the story's villains and can be used at any time, in any order, or not at all. The characters might have reason to visit one or more of these lairs in the course of the adventure. Thwarting the villains doesn't require the characters to invade their lairs or defeat them in combat, so it's possible to complete the adventure without these chapters coming into play.</p><p>Be prepared to make adjustments on the fly if the characters find themselves in a villain's lair prior to completing chapter 4, as the challenges within each lair are difficult for characters of lower than 5th level to overcome. You can gently steer characters in a different direction, drop hints that urge them to use extreme caution, or make deadly encounters easier. It also bears remembering that the villains are meant to be thwarted, not killed, and they are rarely spoiling for a fight. Adventurers who get in over their heads can be knocked unconscious rather than killed. Such characters might awaken in an alley, a sewer tunnel, or a prison cell, with or without their gear. Conversely, they might awaken safe and sound with all their gear in a private residence, being cared for by friendly NPCs who took them in.</p><hr><h3><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion</span></h3><p>The special chapter of this book titled “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZjkxZmZjODdlYmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion</a>” is a tour of the City of Splendors.

The Sea Maidens Faire consists of three carnival ships (the <i>Eyecatcher</i>, the <i>Heartbreaker</i>, and the <i>Hellraiser</i>) crewed by disguised drow and a host of non-drow performers (musicians, acrobats, actors, and the like). The ships' cargo consists mostly of wagons and floats that can be hastily assembled and paraded through the city. The drow use these parades to draw attention away from their illicit activities.</p><p>In the magical guise of a flamboyant Illuskan captain named Zardoz Zord, Jarlaxle oversees things from the <i>Eyecatcher</i>, his flagship, and the <i>Scarlet Marpenoth</i>, a submarine mounted underneath it. He relies on three drow gunslingers—<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTJiNGJlNTc2MjQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Fel'rekt Lafeen</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTBhNjQwNTY2MDFk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Krebbyg Masq'il'yr</a>, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjlkNzNjNWM5ZTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Soluun Xibrindas</a>—to do most of his dirty work in the city.

Members living in Waterdeep help guard the city against unnatural threats, including aberrations and undead. They also watch over the City of the Dead (Waterdeep's public cemetery) and the city's parks.</p><p>Members of the Emerald Enclave can be found in Phaulkonmere, a noble villa in the Southern Ward, and at the Snobeedle Orchard and Meadery in Undercliff.</p><p>The walls of Phaulkonmere enclose fabulous gardens, and the buildings are covered with moss and ivy. The place is owned by descendants of two wealthy families—the Tarms (longtime Waterdavians) and the Phaulkons (who are of Cormyrean descent). They spend most of the year traveling abroad and entrust the estate to a half-elf groundskeeper named Melannor Fellbranch. He is joined by Jeryth Phaulkon, a noblewoman turned demigod who serves Mielikki, divine lady of the forest.</p><p>The Snobeedle Orchard and Meadery is run by the Snobeedle family of halflings, among them an old druid named Blossom Snobeedle. Blossom's youngest son, Dasher, disappeared in Waterdeep about six months ago.

Such action is usually taken as a last resort, since some past members of the group have exhibited a tendency to indulge in wanton violence, causing as much damage as they ostensibly prevent.</p><p>Although the Open Lord sets mission goals and parameters whenever the unit is activated, the Force Grey team needed to complete any given assignment is made up of individuals handpicked by the Blackstaff.</p><p>If members of Force Grey (and, in some cases, the Gray Hands) are arrested for a crime, the Open Lord or the Blackstaff will usually intervene on their behalf and facilitate their release.</p><p><b>Force Grey support comes in these ways:</b></p><ul><li>Adventurers who are arrested are released under the loose supervision of Vajra Safahr.</li><li>The adventurers receive a helpful uncommon or rare magic item that they're allowed to use for a time (until it mysteriously disappears).</li><li>Meloon Wardragon or some other respected member of Force Grey helps the adventurers out of a tough situation.</li></ul><hr><h3><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NmQzMjZkZDFlODYz  style=\"font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold ; background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Harpers</a></h3><p>Any smart, non-evil character can join the Harpers of Waterdeep.

A character pretending to be a Harper can fool her with a successful DC 16 Charisma (Deception) check.</p><p>Otherwise, the characters must either compel Elaspra to release the information using magic, or they must sneak a peek at her records, which she keeps in an iron safe that can be opened with a <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YTA5OGI2YzliM2Zj ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>knock</a></i> spell or similar magic. To pick the combination lock on the safe, a character must succeed on three DC 20 Dexterity (Investigation) checks in a row. Each attempt made to pick the lock requires an action.</p><p>From Elaspra or her records, the characters learn that she sold the key to a man named Volkarr Kibbens, whose address is an old windmill in the Southern Ward. The key unlocks the door to his apartment, which he shares with another man named Urlaster Ghann.</p><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 14px ; font-weight: bold\">Xanathar Guild Ambush</span></h4>As the characters leave the mausoleum, they are jumped by four <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzM2MWQ4OGQxNGNi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>duergar</a></b>, members of the Xanathar Guild, who slipped past the cemetery guards using their invisibility. The leader, Gorath, accosts the characters in Dwarvish, demands the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>, and refuses to believe that they don't have it. If the stone isn't turned over to them promptly, the duergar enlarge themselves and attack. Xanathar watches the battle unfold through the eyes of a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDk4ZTg3ZjFiYjJm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>gazer</a></b>, which stays out of the fight and tries to remain unseen.<p></p><p>If this encounter occurs at night, there's a 50 percent chance that Ambrose Everdawn (LG male human Tethyrian <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWVhMDI1ODFlOGQx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>knight</a></b>) hears the disturbance and investigates, arriving after two duergar fall in battle. The characters can convince him that they're not grave robbers with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If they're polite, Ambrose escorts them out of the City of the Dead and warns them not to trespass again. Otherwise, he attempts to subdue them and turn them over to the City Guard.</p><h4>Next Encounter</h4>Once they trace the key to its owner, the characters can head to the Southern Ward in search of Volkarr Kibbens. The spring chain continues with encounter 10, \"<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDA5MTM1YjEyMDI0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Converted Windmill</a>\".<div><span style=\"font-size: 11pt ; font-family: &#34;arial&#34; ; color: #000000 ; background-color: transparent ; font-style: normal ; font-variant: normal ; text-decoration: none ; vertical-align: baseline ; white-space: pre ; white-space: pre-wrap\"><br></span></div><p></p><p></p></section>","img":""}
{"_id":"ZjNjYzJkNzcwZWFl","name":"Courthouse","permission":{"default":0},"folder":"MjRkMzdmNTY2YTE3","flags":{"R20Converter":{"handout-order":1,"handout-archived":false}},"sort":10000,"entryTime":0,"content":"\n<section class=\"secret\"><p>GM Notes : </p><p></p><h3>Courthouse: Summer</h3>After obtaining the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>, the characters are arrested by the City Watch soon after they emerge from the sewers.<br><br><h4>Under Arrest</h4>The arresting force consists of twelve veterans, a Watch sergeant and eleven constables. They demand that the characters surrender their weapons and come along quietly. For guidance on how to handle character arrests, see Breaking the Law.<br><br>The characters are charged with disturbing the peace, a minor offense that carries a fine and results in an edict. The charge stems from their conduct in encounter 3, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzhlNDk5M2QyOTZh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Street Chase</a>. Depending on how they comported themselves in previous encounters, the characters might be charged with additional crimes against the city or its citizens, possibly including brandishing weapons without due cause, robbery, assaulting a citizen, or murder. If they resist arrest, they are charged with hampering justice. See the Code Legal handout for the penalties associated with such crimes.<br><br>Characters who give up their visible weapons without a fuss aren't searched, but those who give the Watch a hard time are searched for hidden weapons (and stripped of anything that could potentially cause harm). A character can conceal a Tiny object from the Watch with a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i> is found during a search, the Watch sergeant inspects it, concludes that it's nothing of consequence, and returns it to its owner.<br><br><h4>Dock Ward Courthouse</h4>Arrested characters are brought to a courthouse in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjFmODNmZDI3Nzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Dock Ward</a> and confined to cells (area H8) until their trial. Any items taken from them during their arrest are entrusted to the front desk clerk (area H1) pending the trial's outcome. A character can take a short rest while incarcerated and use that time to attune to the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>. After 1d6 hours, word comes down that the magister is prepared to hear the characters' testimony, whereupon the guards in area H8 unlock the characters' cells and escort them to the courtroom (area H5), where the magister is waiting.<br><br><h4>False Captain</h4>If Lord Cassalanter's doppelganger valet <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2Q4Njg3MjlkYmNj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Willifort Crowelle</a></b>&nbsp;is still at large, it kills a Watch captain and uses the victim's uniform to impersonate another Watch captain the characters have met before. Then, in the guise of Hyustus Staget (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmQzNmJkMWQ1ZDEy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Watch Arrives</a>), the doppelganger kills the guards in area H8 with its bare hands and uses their keys to open the characters' cells. “Hyustus” warns them that the magister is corrupt and suggests they flee the city before they're sentenced to death. “Hyustus” offers to deliver messages or items of import on their behalf while they make good their escape. The doppelganger is hoping that the characters will entrust the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i> to it for safekeeping. Failing that, it hopes to wrest the stone from them during the chaos of the jailbreak.<br><br>If the characters refuse to play along, the doppelganger cries out in alarm, bringing the full weight of the courthouse garrison (ten <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDJkNmQ0MmYxODgw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a></b> and two <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veterans</a></b>) down upon the characters, whom “Hyustus” accuses of beating the cell block guards to death. These reinforcements have no reason to believe that Captain Staget isn't who he appears to be, and they side with him in any conflict.<br><br>If the doppelganger obtains the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>, it promptly delivers it to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjgxY2IxOTdjYWJj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Victoro Cassalanter</a>. If the characters extricate themselves from the mess they're in, they can retrieve the stone from Cassalanter Villa.<br><br><h4>Meeting with the Magister</h4>The presiding magister is <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzZkZDY3NjhkMmE3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Magister Umbero Zastro</a></b>, a handsome, eloquent, and fair-minded half-elf in his thirties. He's known for his finely honed sense of poetic justice and for meting out unconventional punishments.<br><br>The magister has already heard the testimony of the arresting officers, as well as that of any eyewitnesses. The characters are given an hour to plead their case while he asks questions. A character who tries to deceive Zastro must make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the magister's Wisdom (Insight) check. A character who loses this contest is found guilty of hampering justice, locked up for a tenday, and fined 200 gp, on top of any other punishments meted out for crimes committed against the city and its citizenry. Those who can't or won't pay the fine are sentenced to hard labor for a year in Amendsfarm, a City Guard-run labor camp among the farms of Undercliff.<br><br>If the characters committed one or more crimes, they are judged guilty and punished accordingly (see the Code Legal handout). A character who pleads for leniency and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check receives an alternate punishment for crimes that don't carry punishments of death or exile. This check is made with advantage if the character has renown in a respectable faction, such as Force Grey (the Gray Hands), the Emerald Enclave, the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, or the Order of the Gauntlet. Alternate punishments for lesser crimes include the following:<p></p><ul><li>The character must make beds and clean bedsheets at local orphanages for a tenday, under guard supervision.</li><li>The character must report to Morana Huldark, a dwarf member of the Guild of Watermen, and scrape barnacles off the docks for a tenday under her close supervision.</li><li>The character must spend the next month delivering 30-pound casks of drinking water to the guards stationed atop the city walls.</li></ul><p>For a tenday, the character must stand on a particular street corner every afternoon from highsun to dusk and, like a broadcrier, shout out the crimes of which he or she has been found guilty while accepting the scoldings and verbal lashings of the citizenry.<br><br>Characters who are tricked into acting in accordance with the wishes of the doppelganger can be forgiven for crimes committed during the jailbreak, but only if the doppelganger is apprehended or killed. (It reverts to its true form when it dies.) <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Speak%20with%20Dead#content\">Speak with dead</a></i> spells can be cast on the cell block guards slain by the doppelganger to obtain testimony that clears the characters of the guards' murder.<br><br></p><h4>Next Encounter</h4>If a character becomes attuned to the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGRmNGVjMDZjYzdk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Stone of Golorr</a></i>, it reveals the location of the Vault of Dragons, beneath an old tower in the Sea Ward, and the three keys needed to enter it. When the characters are ready to visit the location, proceed with encounter 7, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2UwMGRmZDllOTU4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Old Tower</a>.<p></p></section>","img":""}

A three-story mansion lies in the midst of picturesque green gardens dappled with hedges and water features. The estate is surrounded by a tall white brick wall, with a single wrought-iron gate as an entrance. The Cassalanter family crest—a green Y overlapping a stylized goose being fed—is emblazoned on the gate, and armored guards stand at attention on either side.</span></p></blockquote><p><br>Cassalanter Villa is an extravagant manse with dozens of lavish chambers for the masters of the house and their guests—but its splendor belies the terrible secret it holds. The temple of Siamorphe that once lay beneath the estate has been desecrated by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjgxY2IxOTdjYWJj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Victoro</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGJlMGU4MjUwODEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ammalia's</a>&nbsp;devil-worship. Now, this great chapel is dedicated to the Lord of the Nine Hells.</p><hr><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Approaching Cassalanter Villa</span><br></p>The grounds of the Cassalanters' estate are patrolled by hired <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDJkNmQ0MmYxODgw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a></b>. Two of them stand outside the gate of the estate, two more stand outside the front door of the house, and a total of six patrol the grounds at any time. These guards are humans and are outfitted in livery that bears the crest of House Cassalanter.<br><br>The house is surrounded by a well-manicured lawn. A cobblestone path leads from the estate's exterior gate to both the front entrance (area C1) and the entrance to the coach house (area CH1). The villa's grounds feature numerous deciduous trees and meticulously tended gardens.<br><br><h4>Spotted by the Guards</h4>Characters who try to infiltrate Cassalanter Villa are more likely to be arrested than to be killed. The security detail around Cassalanter Villa is meant to raise an alarm and deter petty thieves, not to stop determined adventurers. If the guards spot an intruder, they do the sensible thing: call the authorities.<br><br>The City Watch has small, single-person “watch boxes” set up on nearly every street corner in the Sea Ward, including the intersection just outside the gates of Cassalanter Villa. If a guard sounds the alarm, the Watch member on duty fetches a force of forty City Watch <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzYjU1MDM1MjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>veterans</a></b> to cordon off the property.<br><br><h4>Reinforcements</h4>If the City Watch gets involved, Lord and Lady Cassalanter become worried that someone has caught onto their plot. The number of guards patrolling the grounds doubles, and Victoro dispenses with all human guards inside the house. Whenever a guard is mentioned in an interior area, that guard is now a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDdiOTc1YmEwZDFk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bearded devil</a>&nbsp;</b>disguised as a human. A disguised devil looks like a muscular, bearded male human in house livery. A creature that observes one closely can, with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, notice its “beard” writhing.<br><br><h4>Denizens of Cassalanter Villa</h4>Cassalanter Villa is home to no one but Lord and Lady Cassalanter, their children, their personal attendants, and their guards. All the other servants who work at the villa live in dingy homes in the Dock Ward or the Field Ward and travel across the city in the wee hours of the morning to arrive before the Cassalanters awake.<br><br>With the exception of their personal attendants, the Cassalanters replenish their servants regularly. Most move on to other jobs, but occasionally a servant discovers the secret vault (area C29), visits the forbidden attic (area C24), or otherwise learns too much. Such folk are fated to become sacrifices to Asmodeus.<p></p><hr><p></p><h3>Villa Features</h3>The following features are found throughout the villa:<p></p><ul><li>Ceilings in rooms are 25 feet high, with 7-foot-high corridors and doorways connecting them.</li><li>Doors are made of exotic hardwood. If a door is locked, the lock can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or the door can be forced open by a character who makes a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Victoro, Ammalia, and the head butler, Willifort, hold keys to every room in the house.</li><li>Floors are made of wood and covered with soft woolen carpets. Creatures walking in carpeted rooms have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</li><li>All areas are well lit by oil lamps, lanterns, or chandeliers.</li><li>The Cassalanters keep no silver objects (with the exception of coins) in their house, since silver is harmful to devils.</li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 51 , 51 , 51 ) ; font-family: inherit ; font-size: 18px ; font-weight: bold\">Areas of the Villa</span><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The following areas correspond to the labels on the Villa map.

The desk drawer contains a wax seal bearing the Cassalanter crest, Ammalia Cassalanter's spellbook (which contains all the spells she has prepared), and ten vials of jet-black poison known as midnight tears. Ammalia plans to taint the Founders' Day feast with the poison (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTE1N2UxMDhkOGE4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events</a>).<br></span><br><b><i>Red Grimoire. </i></b>The tome on the desk, bound in crimson leather, details a diabolical ritual that Ammalia and Victoro enacted to first contact the archdevil Asmodeus.

The ritual takes 11 minutes to cast and requires incense and a vial of unholy water (which are consumed during the performance of the ritual). At the end of the ritual, a proxy of Asmodeus appears and grants its summoner the benefit of a <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Commune#content\">commune</a> </i>spell.

The magic of the pentagram can also be dispelled (DC 15). If he is freed, Osvaldo regains control of his chains and attacks indiscriminately. If he is reduced to 0 hit points, the chain devil cries out for his mother before melting into a pool of sickening black ichor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><br></p><h5>C24a.

Six imps in raven form hang around the butterfly garden and occasionally prey on Ammalia's prized pets when their mistress isn't looking. Despite their insolence, Ammalia uses these imps as spies. She sends them on missions throughout the city. They also warn Ammalia of trespassers and attack anyone who threatens a member of her family.<br><br><b><i>Founders' Day. </i></b>During the party, two young, hot-blooded nobles have accidentally offended one another.

It contains spare furniture, a laundry tub, and trunks full of old clothing.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><h4>C27. False Vault</h4>The door to this vault is made of solid iron and sports three different locks. Victoro and Ammalia each have a set of keys for them. Opening the door without the keys requires a character to succeed on three consecutive DC 20 Dexterity checks using thieves' tools. On a failed check, all three locks reset. The door has AC 19, a damage threshold of 10, 90 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A creature can break it down with a successful DC 27 Strength (Athletics) check.<br><br>The vault is empty.<br><br><b><i>Cold Trap. </i></b>If a creature enters the vault without first saying “Gold is my shield,” an intense blast of magical cold fills the room. All creatures in the vault at that time must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br>A <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NGViNGI3MTJmYzQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect magic</a></i> spell reveals the secret to disabling the trap: a tiny magical glyph is inscribed in the middle of the ceiling. If this glyph is dispelled with a successful casting of <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODY4Zjg3NjhmMDkw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>dispel magic</a></i> (DC 16), the trap ceases to function.<p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><h4>C28.

If the sun symbol is pushed, the wall grinds open, revealing area C29 beyond.

They arrive to find the place ransacked (encounter 1, \"<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjkwOGNkNzE4YjVm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Alley</a>\"). The duergar who looted the residence work for the Xanathar Guild, and Bregan D'aerthe spies have tracked them to a cellar complex in the Southern Ward. In the guise of Laeral Silverhand, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTVkMzA3NzY2ZmMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jarlaxle</a> steers the characters in that direction (encounter 9, \"<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTg4ZGM0ODk2ZjQy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Cellar Complex</a>\"). A search of the cellar complex yields a fake stone, but not the real Stone of Golorr.

Jarlaxle makes the characters an offer they can't refuse, setting his agents on them if they dare to do so.</p><p>Once he realizes the Xanathar Guild doesn't have the stone, Jarlaxle asks the characters to interrogate Fenerus to find out where he hid it.

Fenerus wants immunity for all of his past crimes. The characters are in no position to grant his wish, but they might threaten him, persuade him, or use magic to charm him. If he is compelled to reveal the stone's location, Fenerus points the characters to an old tower in the Dock Ward (encounter 7, \"<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDI2MWRmNGNjMWE2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Old Tower</a>\").</p><p>Jarlaxle's lieutenants reach the stone first and flee across the rooftops in the Dock Ward to escape the characters (encounter 5, \"<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2U2Y2IxOTFjNTky ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Rooftop Chase</a>\").

A fire swept through the area a little over a year ago, and most of the buildings are now burned-out shells with (at best) sails for roofs. Fishing poles and nets line the dock, and the 15-foot-deep water is covered by a thick layer of ice during the winter.<p></p><hr><p></p><h3>Areas of Mistshore<br></h3>Mistshore is a riotous assemblage of ramshackle homes made of wood from old ships and inhabited by impoverished Waterdavians. Several buildings were reduced to ash by the fire last year. Although some were rebuilt, others were ruined beyond repair and are now used as roofless dens by homeless children and rats.<br><br>The following locations are keyed to the Mistshore map.<br><br><h4>D1. Kraken's Folly</h4>The Kraken's Folly is a beached pirate ship that some residents of Mistshore use as a tenement. At any given time, 4d6 <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzAzZTRmMDczZTBj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bandits</a></b> loiter on deck, hoping that someone who needs muscle will offer them work.

To meet the mage's demands, the characters must spend a day searching the harbor. At the end of the day, the pilot makes an Intelligence (Investigation) check. Multiply the total of the check by 10 to determine the gold piece value of any treasure found. Grinda sells the bounty and gives half to the characters.<br><br>As the characters search the harbor for treasure, roll any die. If an even number is rolled, an awakened shark named <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjExYTk4MDBlYTc0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Obliteros</a></b> attacks them. Grinda has had several close encounters with the shark recently, but fails to mention this to the characters for fear of scaring them off.<p></p><p></p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/013_-_Dragon_Heist_3A_Autumn_Adventure/000_-_Chapter_4_3A_Dragon_Season/007_-_Encounter_2_3A_Mistshore/000_-_Areas_of_Mistshore/avatar.png"}

The genasi smiths <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmRmYjE2MjI3NGNh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Embric</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmJhM2VhMzM1ODI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Avi</a> (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzU2ZGM5ODNiOTc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Trollskull Alley</a>, area T3) can acquire one if the characters think to ask them.</p><h4>Animated Construct</h4><p>Any creature of the construct type works as this key, provided the creature hasn't been destroyed or rendered inoperable. If the characters have befriended <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjIyYzA1YTRmMjk4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Valetta</a>, the dragonborn priest of Gond (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MjE3MjQxNmJhODcz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Nim's Secret</a>), she happily releases Nim the nimblewright into their custody until they no longer have need of it.</p><p>An object animated by the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZTZiMGU0NTUxNTBm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>animate objects</a></i> spell also qualifies as this key.</p><h4>Beardless Dwarf</h4><p>Most female dwarves are beardless and thus meet the condition. A male dwarf NPC can be persuaded to shave his beard, either as a consequence of losing a bet or upon receiving some sort of recompense. The characters can also shave a male dwarf they have captured or against whom they have some sort of leverage.</p><h4>Beholder Eyestalk</h4><p>The eyestalk need not come from a true, living beholder. It can be plucked from a stuffed beholder (see “Old Xoblob Shop” in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWQ2MzBjYWVhMzgw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>A Friend in Need</a>) or obtained from a lesser form of beholderkin, such as a gazer or a spectator. The eyestalk also need not be detached.</p><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzMyNGExNTJhZjA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Xanathar</a> gladly accompanies characters to the vault if that's the way to guarantee getting its share of the treasure. Regardless of the arrangement it makes with the characters, “its share” equates to all the treasure. In other words, Xanathar turns on the party once the vault is unlocked, unless a powerful NPC (such as Laeral Silverhand or Vajra Safahr) is present to keep the mad beholder in check.</p><h4>Bronze Dragon Scale</h4><p>Zelifarn, a <b><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODFlY2IyZTFmYTcw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>young bronze dragon</a></b>, has taken up residence in Deepwater Harbor. Many sailors and dock workers have seen the dragon, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDAwY2FmYjU4YzNm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Grinda Garloth</a> owns an <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTdlM2M2Njg3MDg4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>apparatus of Kwalish</a></i> that characters can use to search for the dragon. Characters who go looking for Zelifarn find him lurking inside a shipwreck 120 feet underwater. As the characters approach the wreck, Zelifarn comes out and tries to scare them away. (He's not done searching the wreck for treasure.) He inflicts harm only in self-defense.</p><p>A successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check or an offer of treasure worth at least 1,000 gp convinces the dragon to talk with the characters and part with one of his scales. If the characters mention the contents of the Vault of Dragons, Zelifarn demands a promise of 10 percent of the gold before he gives them what they came for.</p><p><b><i>Roll20 Note:</i></b> If the DM would like to run this encounter on a map, the maps can be found in the Spring, Summer, and Winter storylines.</p><h4>Cask of Dwarven Ale</h4><p>A cask of dwarven ale is easily obtained at any market in Waterdeep for 5 gp. There is a 20 percent chance that the characters buy a knock-off brand that isn't made by dwarves. Any dwarf character can tell genuine dwarven ale from the fake stuff simply by having a taste.</p><h4>Drunken Elf</h4><p>Any elf who is poisoned from drinking alcohol qualifies as this key.</p><h4>Gems Worth at Least 1,000 gp</h4><p>One or more gemstones qualify as this key as long as their combined value is 1,000 gp or more. Such gems can be found during the adventure or bought in the markets of Waterdeep.</p><h4>Gift from a Queen</h4><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWM1M2NkZmE0YmI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Laeral Silverhand</a>, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, was once the queen of an ancient kingdom called Stornanter. The characters can recall this fact with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (History) check or learn it through information gathering. They can request an audience with Laeral through <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTM2MDgyNjViNmYw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jalester Silvermane</a> or <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWJlODY4YWM1OGRk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Mirt</a>. Laeral gives them a gift—a feather quill given to her by the archmage Elminster himself—if they promise to return the stolen gold to Waterdeep's coffers.</p><h4>Invisible Creature</h4><p>Any creature under the effect of an <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YjRmMjczMGQ0YTVl ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>invisibility</a></i> spell counts as this key, as do naturally invisible creatures.</p><h4>Painting of a Dwarf Miner</h4><p>A painting of a dwarf miner priced at 5d10 gp can be found each day a character spends searching art shops. A character proficient with painter's supplies can create a painting that qualifies as this key. It takes 3d6 hours to finish the painting.</p><h4>Pair of Bugbear Ears</h4><p>The Xanathar Guild employs bugbears, and characters can chop the ears off any of them. A live bugbear also counts as this key.</p><h4>Performance of “Your Beardy Face”</h4><p>The dwarf love song, “Your Beardy Face,” is a duet performed by bagpipers. The characters can obtain this music easily for 1 gp and hire two performers to play the piece for 10 gp each. A character who has proficiency with bagpipes can perform the song, though a successful DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check using bagpipes is required for the performance to count as this key. A glass jar in Cassalanter Villa (see the Hell of a Summer add-on, area C3) plays this song when it is uncorked.</p><h4>Severed Drow Hand</h4><p>This ghastly key can be forcibly obtained from a member of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YmY5NGQ5YWUwM2M5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Bregan D'aerthe</a> or some other dark elf. If the characters have encountered no drow, they might hear rumors that Xanathar employs a drow advisor.</p><h4>Shapechanger</h4><p>Any living creature of the shapechanger subtype, such as a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGZmN2U3ZDEyMzYz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>doppelganger</a> or a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTI3ZGRhNzcxMzVj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wererat</a>, serves as this key. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzAyYTU1NTkzYjFm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Bonnie</a> the doppelganger (see “Familiar Faces”) can be persuaded to accompany the characters if she is friendly toward one or more of them. The characters can also reach out to the Shard Shunners, a local gang of halfling wererats. For an up-front payment of 500 gp, the wererats happily oblige.</p><h4>Silvered Warhammer</h4><p>The characters can buy a silvered warhammer for 115 gp, or they can give a silver bar to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmRmYjE2MjI3NGNh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Embric</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmJhM2VhMzM1ODI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Avi</a> (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzU2ZGM5ODNiOTc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Trollskull Alley</a>, area T3) and have the genasi smiths craft one.</p><h4>Sunlight</h4><p>Since the vault lies deep underground, natural sunlight is difficult to come by. Clever characters can buy twenty steel mirrors (5 gp each) and arrange them in places (and at the proper angles) so that sunlight from outside can be reflected underground and shone upon the vault entrance. Setting up these mirrors and getting their alignment just right takes 2d4+2 hours regardless of the number of characters involved.</p><h4>Unicorn</h4><p>Although conjuring up a real unicorn is likely beyond the abilities of the characters, they could ask <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWM1M2NkZmE0YmI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Laeral Silverhand</a> or Vajra Safahr to cast the <i><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZTk4MmUyMzBjNDY1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>summon celestial</a></i> spell. The characters can gain an audience with Laeral or Vajra through <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjVkOTBiZjc2MjEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Renaer Neverember</a> or another well-connected NPC. If the characters tell Laeral or Vajra the truth about the Vault of Dragons and promise to turn the gold over to the authorities, either one agrees to accompany the characters to the vault and cast the spell.</p><p>The unicorn need not be a real unicorn to serve as this key. The Sea Maidens Faire (see the Maestro's Fall add-on) uses a unicorn float in its parades, and a stuffed unicorn can be found in Cassalanter Villa (see the Hell of a Summer add-on, area T18).</p></section>","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/journal/004_-_Chapter_4_3A_Dragon_Season/003_-_Vault_Keys/avatar.png"}
