As they mature, fungi eject spores that drift on the lightest breeze to spawn new fungi.<br><br>Not needing sunlight or warmth to grow, fungi thrive in every corner and crevice of the Underdark. Transformed by the magic that permeates that underground realm, Underdark fungi often develop potent defensive mechanisms or abilities of mimicry and attack. The largest specimens can spread to create vast subterranean forests in which countless creatures live and feed.<br><br>\n<h2>Gas Spore</h2>The first gas spores are thought to have been spawned from dead beholders, whose moldering corpses fed a parasitic fungus with aberrant magic. Having long since adapted into a unique plant creature, a gas spore grows quickly and purposefully out of any corpse, creating a malevolent-looking mockery of the most feared denizen of the Underdark.<br><br><strong><em>Eye Tyrant’s Form.</em></strong> A gas spore is a spherical, balloon-like fungus that resembles a beholder from a distance, though its true nature becomes increasingly obvious as one approaches it. The monster possesses a blind central “eye” and rhizome growths sprouting from its upper surface, superficially resembling a beholder’s eyestalks.<br><br><strong><em>Death Burst.</em></strong> A gas spore is a hollow shell filled with a lighter-than-air gas that enables it to float as a beholder does. Piercing the shell with even the weakest attack causes the creature to burst apart, releasing a cloud of deadly spores. A creature that inhales the spores becomes host to them, and is often dead within a day. Its corpse then becomes the spawning ground from which new gas spores arise.<br><br><strong><em>Beholder Memories.</em></strong> A gas spore that sprouts from a beholder’s corpse sometimes carries within it memories of its deceased parent. When the gas spore explodes, its deadly spores cast those memories adrift. Any creature that inhales the spores and survives inherits one or more of the beholder’s fragmented memories, and might gain useful information about the beholder’s former lair and other nearby places and creatures of interest.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Death Burst</strong>: The gas spore explodes when it drops to 0 hit points. Each creature within 20 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage and become infected with a disease on a failed save. Creatures immune to the poisoned condition are immune to this disease.<br><br>Spores invade an infected creature’s system, killing the creature in a number of hours equal to 1d12 + the creature’s Constitution score, unless the disease is removed. In half that time, the creature becomes poisoned for the rest of the duration. After the creature dies, it sprouts 2d4 Tiny gas spores that grow to full size in 7 days.<br><br><strong>Eerie Resemblance</strong>: The gas spore resembles a beholder.

Wizards and warlocks of a dark bent use crawling claws as extra hands in their labors.<br><br><strong><em>Magical Origins. </em></strong>Through dark necromantic rituals, the life force of a murderer is bound to its severed hand, haunting and animating it. If a dead murderer’s spirit already manifests as another undead creature, if the murderer is raised from death, or if the spirit has long passed on to another plane, the ritual fails.<br><br>The ritual invoked to create a crawling claw works best with a hand recently severed from a murderer. To this end, ritualists and their servants frequent public executions to gain possession of suitable hands, or make bargains with assassins and torturers.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Creator’s Control.</em></strong> A crawling claw can’t be turned, nor can it be controlled by spells that control undead. These foul monsters are entirely bound to the will of their creator, which can concentrate on a claw in sight to mentally command its every action. If the crawling claw’s creator doesn’t command it, the claw follows its last command to the best of its ability.<br><br>Commands given to a crawling claw must be simple. A claw can’t be tasked with finding and killing a particular person, because its limited senses and intelligence prevent it from tracking and picking out specific individuals. However, a command to kill all creatures in a particular locale works. A crawling claw can easily feel out the contours of keys and doorknobs, crawling from room to room on a blind killing spree.<br><br><strong><em>Malign Intelligence.</em></strong> A crawling claw possesses little of the intellect and memories of the individual of which it was once a living part. The hate, jealousy, or greed that drove that person to murder lingers on, however, amplified by the claw’s torturous fragmented state. Left to its own devices, a crawling claw imitates and recreates the same murderous acts it committed in life.\n\tLiving Claws. If a crawling claw is animated from the severed hand of a still-living murderer, the ritual binds the claw to the murderer’s soul. The disembodied hand can then return to its former limb, its undead flesh knitting to the living arm from which it was severed.<br><br>Made whole again, the murderer acts as though the hand had never been severed and the ritual had never taken place. When the crawling claw separates again, the living body falls into a coma. Destroying the crawling claw while it is away from the body kills the murderer.

Aggressive, hateful, and greedy, these aberrations dismiss all other creatures as lesser beings, toying with them or destroying them as they choose.<br><br>A beholder’s spheroid body levitates at all times, and its great bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw, while the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and turn to keep its foes in sight. When a beholder sleeps, it closes its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes open and alert.<br><br><strong><em>Xenophobic Isolationists.</em></strong> Enemies abound, or so every beholder believes. Beholders are convinced that other creatures resent them for their brilliance and magical power, even as they dismiss those lesser creatures as crude and disgusting. Beholders always suspect others of plotting against them, even when no other creatures are around.<br><br>The disdain a beholder has for other creatures extends to other beholders. Each beholder believes its form to be an ideal, and that any deviation from that form is a flaw in the racial purity of its kind. Beholders vary greatly in their physical forms, making conflict between them inevitable. Some beholders are protected by overlapping chitinous plates. Some have smooth hides. Some have eyestalks that writhe like tentacles, while others’ stalks bear crustacean-like joints. Even slight differences of coloration in hide can turn two beholders into lifelong enemies.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/25981067/gFNe0L09lZdJhwcvN-Z7Pw/med.jpg?1480962559\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\"><strong><em>Eye Tyrant.</em></strong> Some beholders manage to channel their xenophobic tendencies into a terrible despotism. Rather than live in isolation, the aptly named eye tyrants enslave those other creatures, founding and controlling vast empires. An eye tyrant sometimes carves out a domain within or under a major city, commanding networks of agents that operate on their master’s behalf.<br><br><strong><em>Alien Lairs.</em></strong> Because they refuse to share territory with others, most beholders withdraw to frigid hills, abandoned ruins, and deep caverns to scheme. A beholder’s lair is carved out by its disintegration eye ray, emphasizing vertical passages connecting chambers stacked on top of each other. Such an environment allows a beholder to move freely, even as it prevents intruders from easily creeping about. When intruders do break in, the height of its open ceilings allows a beholder to float up and harry foes on the floor.<br><br>As alien as their creator, the rooms in a beholder’s lair reflect the creature’s arrogance. It festoons its chambers with trophies from the battles it has won, including petrified adventurers standing frozen in their horrified final moments, pieces of other beholders, and magic items wrested from powerful foes. A beholder judges its own worth by its acquisitions, and it never willingly parts with its treasures.<br><br><h2>Spectator</h2>A spectator is a lesser beholder that is summoned from another plane of existence by a magical ritual, the components of which include four beholder eyestalks that are consumed by the ritual’s magic. Appropriately, a spectator has four eyestalks, two on each side of the wide eye at the center of its four-foot diameter body.<br><br><strong><em>Magical Guardians.</em></strong> A summoned spectator guards a location or a treasure of its summoner’s choice for 101 years, allowing no creature but its summoner to enter the area or access the item, unless the summoner instructed otherwise. If the item is stolen or destroyed before the years have all passed, a summoned spectator vanishes. It otherwise never abandons its post.<br><br><strong><em>Glimmers of Madness.</em></strong> Though it can speak, a spectator communicates primarily by way of telepathy. It is civil while on guard, openly discussing its orders and its summoner. However, even a brief conversation with a spectator is enough to reveal quirks in its personality brought on by its years of isolation. It might invent imaginary enemies, refer to itself in the third person, or try to adopt the voice of its summoner.<br><br>Like any beholder, a spectator views itself as the epitome of its kind, and it has an intense hatred of other spectators. If two spectators encounter one another, they almost always fight to the death.<br><br><strong><em>Freed from Service.</em></strong> When a spectator has fulfilled its service, it is free to do as it pleases. Many take up residence in the places they previously guarded, especially if their summoners have died. With the spectator’s loss of purpose, the flickers of madness it displayed during its servitude flourish.\n\n<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 2 (1d6 - 1) piercing damage.\n\n<br><br><strong>Eye Rays</strong>: The spectator shoots up to two of the following magical eye rays at one or two creatures it can see within 90 feet of it. It can use each ray only once on a turn.<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">\n<strong>1. Confusion Ray</strong>: The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, or it can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn. On its turn, the target can’t move, and it uses its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly determined creature within range. If the target can’t attack, it does nothing on its turn.<br><strong>2. Paralyzing Ray</strong>: The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><strong>3. Fear Ray</strong>: The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><strong>4. Wounding Ray</strong>: The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</div><br><br><strong>Create Food and Water</strong>: The spectator magically creates enough food and water to sustain itself for 24 hours.<br><br><h2>Reactions</h2><strong>Spell Reflection</strong>: If the spectator makes a successful saving throw against a spell, or a spell attack misses it, the spectator can choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it can see within 30 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creature instead of the spectator. If the spell forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own save.

They mark the borders of their territories with cracked bones and skulls, or with pictographs painted in blood or dung.<br><br>\n\tPerhaps the most loathsome of all humanoids, troglodytes eat anything they can stomach. They dwell in filth. The walls of their cavern homes are smeared with grime, oily secretions, and the debris of their foul feasting.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSimpleminded Brutes.</em></strong> Troglodytes have a simple, communal culture devoted almost entirely to procuring food. Too simple to plan more than a few days into the future, troglodytes rely on constant raids and hunting to survive. They take sadistic pleasure in hunting intelligent creatures weaker than themselves and show no mercy toward those they capture and drag back to their lairs to be devoured. The largest and toughest troglodytes lead the hunt and become the leaders of their tribes. However, if a leader shows any weakness or hesitation, other troglodytes attack and eat it in a frenzy.<br><br>\n\tTroglodytes make little and build less, scavenging their possessions from their prey. They understand the value of metal weapons and armor, and fight among one another for the right to have such items. A troglodyte tribe might be torn apart by battles over a single longsword.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDevotees of Laogzed.</em></strong> Some troglodytes venerate Laogzed, a demonic, monstrously fat toad-lizard that slumbers in the Abyss. Laogzed offers the troglodytes nothing in return except aspiration, for it is the dream of his troglodyte worshipers to become as fat, well-fed, and wearily content as he seems to be.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Chameleon Skin</strong>: The troglodyte has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Stench</strong>: Any creature other than a troglodyte that starts its turn within 5 feet of the troglodyte must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature’s next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all troglodytes for 1 hour.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Sunlight Sensitivity</strong>: While in sunlight, the troglodyte has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The troglodyte makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Claw</strong>:

The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.<br><br><strong><em>Lords of Tyranny.</em></strong> Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.<br><br>Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.<br><br><strong><em>Obedience and Ambition.</em></strong> In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.<br><br>At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.<br><br><strong><em>Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers.</em></strong> Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus’s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.<br><br>To own a creature’s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal’s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.<br><br><h2>The Infernal Hierarchy</h2>The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26111839/icO5Q3Fw_QzloxCpLG19pg/med.jpg?1481310510\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\">A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.<br><br>If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever—a fate that even Asmodeus fears.<br><br><strong><em>Archdevils.</em></strong> The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.<br><br><strong><em>Greater Devils.</em></strong> The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.<br><br><strong><em>Lesser Devils.</em></strong> The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Lemures.</em></strong> The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.<br><br><strong><em>Promotion and Demotion.</em></strong> When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil’s memories passing intact from one form to the next.<br><br>Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.<br><br><h3>Infernal Hierarchy</h3>1. lemure<br><br><strong>Lesser devils<br></strong>2. imp<br>3. spined devil<br>4. bearded devil<br>5. barbed devil<br>6. chain devil<br>7. bone devil<br><br><strong>Greater devils<br></strong>8. horned devil<br>9. erinyes<br>10. ice devil<br>11. pit fiend<br><br><strong>Archdevils<br></strong>12. duke or duchess<br>13. archduke or archduchess\n\n\n\t<br><br>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories—and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.<br><br>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other’s most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.<br><br><h3>The Nine Hells</h3>The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by archdevils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.<br><br><h2>Devil True Names and Talismans</h2>Though devils all have common names, every devil above a lemure in station also has a true name that it keeps secret. A devil can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the true names of certain devils.<br><br>\n\tA mortal who learns a devil’s true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the devil from the Nine Hells and bind it into service. Binding can also be accomplished with the help of a devil talisman. Each of these ancient relics is inscribed with the true name of a devil it controls, and was bathed in the blood of a worthy sacrifice—typically someone the creator loved—when crafted.<br><br>\n\tHowever it is summoned, a devil brought to the Material Plane typically resents being pressed into service. However, the devil seizes every opportunity to corrupt its summoner so that the summoner’s soul ends up in the Nine Hells. Only imps are truly content to be summoned, and they easily commit to serving a summoner as a familiar, but they still do their utmost to corrupt those who summon them.\n\n<br><br><h2>Barbed Devil (Hamatula)</h2>Creatures of unbridled greed and desire, barbed devils act as guards to the more powerful denizens of the Nine Hells and their vaults. Resembling a tall humanoid covered in sharp barbs, spines, and hooks, a barbed devil has gleaming eyes that are ever watchful for objects and creatures it might claim for itself. These fiends welcome any chance to fight when victory promises reward.<br><br>Barbed devils are known for an alertness that makes them difficult to surprise, and they attend to their duties without boredom or distraction. They use their sharp claws as weapons or hurl balls of flame at foes that try to flee them.<br><br><h3>Layers and the Lords of the Nine Hells</h3><table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Layer</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Layer Name</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Archduke or Archduchess</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Previous Rulers</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Primary Inhabitants</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Avernus</td>\n<td>Zariel</td>\n<td>Bel, Tiamat</td>\n<td>Erinyes, imps, spined devils</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Dis</td>\n<td>Dispater</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Bearded devils, erinyes, imps, spined devils</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Minauros</td>\n<td>Mammon</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Bearded devils, chain devils, imps, spined devils</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Phlegethos</td>\n<td>Belial and Fierna</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Barbed devils, bone devils, imps, spined devils</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Stygia</td>\n<td>Levistus</td>\n<td>Geryon</td>\n<td>Bone devils, erinyes, ice devils, imps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Malbolge</td>\n<td>Glasya</td>\n<td>Malagard, Moloch</td>\n<td>Barbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Maladomini</td>\n<td>Baalzebul</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Barbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Cania</td>\n<td>Mephistopheles</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>Horned devils, ice devils, imps, pit fiends</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Nessus</td>\n<td>Asmodeus</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>All devils </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Barbed Hide</strong>: At the start of each of its turns, the barbed devil deals 5 (1d10) piercing damage to any creature grappling it.<br><br><strong>Devil's Sight</strong>: Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.<br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The devil makes three melee attacks: one with its tail and two with its claws.

The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.<br><br><strong><em>Lords of Tyranny.</em></strong> Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.<br><br>Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.<br><br><strong><em>Obedience and Ambition.</em></strong> In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.<br><br>At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.<br><br><strong><em>Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers.</em></strong> Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus’s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.<br><br>To own a creature’s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal’s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.<br><br><h2>The Infernal Hierarchy</h2>The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26111839/icO5Q3Fw_QzloxCpLG19pg/med.jpg?1481310510\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\">A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.<br><br>If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever—a fate that even Asmodeus fears.<br><br><strong><em>Archdevils.</em></strong> The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.<br><br><strong><em>Greater Devils.</em></strong> The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.<br><br><strong><em>Lesser Devils.</em></strong> The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Lemures.</em></strong> The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.<br><br><strong><em>Promotion and Demotion.</em></strong> When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil’s memories passing intact from one form to the next.<br><br>Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.<br><br><h3>Infernal Hierarchy</h3>1. lemure<br><br><strong>Lesser devils<br></strong>2. imp<br>3. spined devil<br>4. bearded devil<br>5. barbed devil<br>6. chain devil<br>7. bone devil<br><br><strong>Greater devils<br></strong>8. horned devil<br>9. erinyes<br>10. ice devil<br>11. pit fiend<br><br><strong>Archdevils<br></strong>12. duke or duchess<br>13. archduke or archduchess\n\n\n\t<br><br>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories—and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.<br><br>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other’s most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.<br><br><h3>The Nine Hells</h3>The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by archdevils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.<br><br><h2>Devil True Names and Talismans</h2>Though devils all have common names, every devil above a lemure in station also has a true name that it keeps secret. A devil can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the true names of certain devils.<br><br>\n\tA mortal who learns a devil’s true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the devil from the Nine Hells and bind it into service. Binding can also be accomplished with the help of a devil talisman. Each of these ancient relics is inscribed with the true name of a devil it controls, and was bathed in the blood of a worthy sacrifice—typically someone the creator loved—when crafted.<br><br>\n\tHowever it is summoned, a devil brought to the Material Plane typically resents being pressed into service. However, the devil seizes every opportunity to corrupt its summoner so that the summoner’s soul ends up in the Nine Hells. Only imps are truly content to be summoned, and they easily commit to serving a summoner as a familiar, but they still do their utmost to corrupt those who summon them.\n\n\n<br><br><h2>Lemure</h2>A lemure arises when a mortal soul is twisted by evil and banished to the Nine Hells for eternity. The lowest type of devil, lemures are repugnant, shapeless creatures doomed to suffer torment until they are promoted to a higher form of devil, most commonly an imp.<br><br>\n\tA lemure resembles a molten mass of flesh with a vaguely humanoid head and torso. A permanent expression of anguish twists across its face, its feeble mouth babbling even though it can’t speak.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h3>Layers and the Lords of the Nine Hells</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Layer</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Layer Name</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Archduke or Archduchess</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Previous Rulers</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Primary Inhabitants</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n1\n</td>\n<td>\nAvernus\n</td>\n<td>\nZariel\n</td>\n<td>\nBel, Tiamat\n</td>\n<td>\nErinyes, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n2\n</td>\n<td>\nDis\n</td>\n<td>\nDispater\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBearded devils, erinyes, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n3\n</td>\n<td>\nMinauros\n</td>\n<td>\nMammon\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBearded devils, chain devils, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n4\n</td>\n<td>\nPhlegethos\n</td>\n<td>\nBelial and Fierna\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n5\n</td>\n<td>\nStygia\n</td>\n<td>\nLevistus\n</td>\n<td>\nGeryon\n</td>\n<td>\nBone devils, erinyes, ice devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n6\n</td>\n<td>\nMalbolge\n</td>\n<td>\nGlasya\n</td>\n<td>\nMalagard, Moloch\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n7\n</td>\n<td>\nMaladomini\n</td>\n<td>\nBaalzebul\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n8\n</td>\n<td>\nCania\n</td>\n<td>\nMephistopheles\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nHorned devils, ice devils, imps, pit fiends\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n9\n</td>\n<td>\nNessus\n</td>\n<td>\nAsmodeus\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nAll devils&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Devil's Sight</strong>: Magical darkness doesn't impede the lemure's darkvision.<br><br><strong>Hellish Rejuvenation</strong>: A lemure that dies in the Nine Hells comes back to life with all its hit points in 1d10 days unless it is killed by a good-aligned creature with a <em>bless</em> spell cast on that creature or its remains are sprinkled with holy water.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2><strong>Fist</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-1ffea4c4-01bb-4c2f-7ab0-036c7d38427d\"></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">If the Cassalanters fail to obtain the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>, Getting the Gold and Day of the Damned don't come to pass.

They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAnimated Dead.</em></strong> Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling dismantled limbs. This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.<br><br>\n\tWhile most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tObedient Servants.</em></strong> Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can’t read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.<br><br>\n\tA skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.<br><br>\n\tAlthough they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren’t mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn’t work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHabitual Behaviors.</em></strong> Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master’s control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can’t eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.<br><br>\n\tWhen skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUndead Nature.</em></strong> A skeleton doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Shortsword</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Shortbow</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p>In the 3rd level Emerald Enclave mission,&nbsp;Convincing Ambrose Everdawn (LG male human Tethyrian knight) that the party intends to help requires a successful DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

Its legs end in sharp hooks adapted for burrowing and grasping its prey, and its powerful mandibles can snap a small tree in half.<br><br><strong><em>Lurkers in the Earth. </em></strong>The ankheg uses its powerful mandibles to dig winding tunnels deep beneath the ground. When it hunts, an ankheg burrows upward, waiting below the surface until its antennae detect movement from above. Then it bursts from the earth and seizes prey in its mandibles, crushing and grinding while it secretes acidic digestive enzymes. These enzymes help dissolve a victim for easy swallowing, but the ankheg can also squirt acid to take down foes.<br><br><strong><em>Bane of Field and Forest.</em></strong> Although ankhegs receive a certain portion of their nutrients from the soil through which they burrow, they must supplement their diet with fresh meat. Pastures teeming with grazing livestock and forests rife with game are an ankheg’s prime hunting grounds. Ankhegs are thus the bane of farmers and rangers everywhere.<br><br><strong><em>Earthen Tunnels.</em></strong> As it burrows through earth, the ankheg leaves a narrow, partially collapsed tunnel in its wake.

It resembles the beholder who dreamed it into existence, but its body is only 8 inches wide, and it has only four eyestalks. It follows its creator like a devoted, aggressive puppy, and sometimes small packs of these creatures patrol their master’s lair for vermin to kill and lone creatures to harass.<br><br><strong><em>Nuisance Pet.</em></strong> A gazer can’t speak any languages but can approximate mimicking words and sentences in a high-pitched, mocking manner. Beholders find gazers amusing and tolerate their presence like spoiled pets. A gazer can’t be tamed by anyone but its creator, except through the use of magic or by bonding with a spellcaster (see sidebar). Some beholders with wizard minions insist they take a gazer as a familiar because they can see through the eyes of these creatures.<br><br><strong><em>Aggressive Vermin-Eater.</em></strong> A wild gazer (one living separately from a beholder) is territorial, eats bugs and small animals, and is known for playing with its food. A lone gazer avoids picking fights with creatures that are Medium or larger, but a pack of them might take on larger prey. A gazer might follow humanoids in its territory, noisily mimicking their speech and generally being a nuisance, until they leave the area, but it flees if confronted by something it can’t kill.<br><br><h2>Variant: Gazer Familiar&nbsp;</h2>Spellcasters who are interested in unusual familiars find that gazers are eager to serve someone who has magical power, especially those who make a point of bullying and harassing others. The gazer behaves aggressively toward creatures smaller than itself, and it tends to randomly attack house pets, farm animals, and even children in town unless its master is very strict. A gazer serving as a familiar has the following trait.<br><br><strong><em>Familiar.</em></strong> The gazer can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master, provided that the master is at least a 3rd-level spellcaster. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the gazer senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. If its master causes it physical harm, the gazer will end its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Aggressive</strong>: As a bonus action, the gazer can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.<br><br><strong>Mimicry</strong>: The gazer can mimic simple sounds of speech it has heard, in any language. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 1 (1d1) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Eye Rays</strong>: The gazer shoots two of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one or two targets it can see within 60 feet of it:<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">\n<strong>1. Dazing Ray</strong>: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of the gazer’s next turn. While the target is charmed in this way, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls.<br><strong>2. Fear Ray</strong>: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of the gazer’s next turn.<br><strong>3. Frost Ray</strong>: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) cold damage.<br><strong>4. Telekinetic Ray</strong>: If the target is a creature that is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be moved up to 30 feet directly away from the gazer.<br><br>If the target is an object weighing 10 pounds or less that isn’t being worn or carried, the gazer moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. The gazer can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a container.</div>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-2e244209-fdbd-ddd3-15d6-30c168ad9223\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Uza (LG female human Mulan commoner) describes the threat as a “monstrous orb of many eyes” that chased her cat, Fillipa, into the shop.

They have no society to speak of, but they do serve as mercenaries to orcs, ogres, ettins, hags, and giants. As payment, trolls demand food and treasure. Trolls are difficult to control, however, doing as they please even when working with more powerful creatures.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tRegeneration.</em></strong> Smashing a troll’s bones and slashing through its rubbery hide only makes it angry. A troll’s wounds close quickly. If the monster loses an arm, a leg, or even its head, those dismembered parts can sometimes act with a life of their own. A troll can even reattach severed body parts, untroubled by its momentary disability. Only acid and fire can arrest the regenerative properties of a troll’s flesh. The trolls, enraged, will attack individuals making acid and fire attacks against them above all other prey.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTroll Freaks.</em></strong> Their regenerative capabilities make trolls especially susceptible to mutation. Although uncommon, such transformations can result from what the troll has done or what has been done to it. A decapitated troll might grow two heads from the stump of its neck, while a troll that eats a fey creature might gain one or more of that creature’s traits.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Keen Smell</strong>: The troll has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Regeneration</strong>: The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the troll's next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.<br><br>\n\n<strong>(Variant) Loathsome Limbs</strong>: Whenever the troll takes at least 15 slashing damage at one time, roll a d20 to determine what else happens to it:<br><br>\n1-10: Nothing else happens.<br>\n11-14: One leg is severed from the troll if it has any legs left.<br>\n15- 18: One arm is severed from the troll if it has any arms left.<br>\n19-20: The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it can't regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head.<br><br>\nIf the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on the troll's initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll's Regeneration trait.<br><br>\nA severed leg is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.<br><br>\nA severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.<br><br>\nIf its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it. The severed head has a speed of 0 feet and the troll's Keen Smell trait. It can make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.<br><br>\nThe troll's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The troll makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. Death. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save. Discord. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Fear. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able. Hopelessness. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects. Insanity. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic. Pain. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save. Sleep. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. On Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to. Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":"","units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":260000},{"_id":"Y2Q0NWE3YmIxM2Nl","flags":{},"name":"Dagger (Melee)","type":"weapon","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/138_-_Remallia_Haventree/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><p><strong></strong><em>Melee Weapon Attack </em>+6, Reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit : </em>4 (1d4+2) piercing damage</p></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":0,"attuned":false,"equipped":true,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":5,"long":"","units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"dex","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1d4+2","piercing"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"weaponType":"natural","properties":{"amm":false,"hvy":false,"fin":false,"fir":false,"foc":false,"lgt":false,"rch":false,"rel":false,"ret":false,"spc":false,"thr":false,"two":false,"ver":false},"proficient":true},"sort":270000},{"_id":"ZmNjZjdjNzQxMTZm","flags":{},"name":"Dagger (Ranged)","type":"weapon","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/138_-_Remallia_Haventree/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><p><strong></strong><em>Ranged Weapon Attack </em>+6, Range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit : </em>4 (1d4+2) piercing damage</p></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":0,"attuned":false,"equipped":true,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":20,"long":60,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"dex","actionType":"rwak","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1d4+2","piercing"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"weaponType":"natural","properties":{"amm":false,"hvy":false,"fin":false,"fir":false,"foc":false,"lgt":false,"rch":false,"rel":false,"ret":false,"spc":false,"thr":false,"two":false,"ver":false},"proficient":true},"sort":280000}]}

A shield guardian treads beside its master, absorbing damage to keep its master alive as long as possible.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Master’s Amulet.</em></strong> Every shield guardian has an amulet magically linked to it. A shield guardian can have only one corresponding amulet, and if that amulet is destroyed, the shield guardian is incapacitated until a replacement amulet is created. A shield guardian’s amulet is subject to direct attack if it isn’t being worn or carried. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.<br><br>\n\tA shield guardian’s solitary focus is to protect the amulet’s wearer. The amulet’s wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.<br><br>\n\tA spellcaster can store a single spell within a shield guardian, which can then cast the spell on command or under specific conditions. Many a wizard has been rendered helpless by enemies, only to surprise those foes when its shield guardian unleashes potent magical power.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Magnificent Treasure.</em></strong> Because a shield guardian’s ownership can be transferred by giving its matching amulet to another creature, some wizards collect exorbitant sums from princes, nobles, and crime lords to create shield guardians for them. At the same time, a shield guardian makes a mighty prize for anyone who slays its master and claims its amulet.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Construct Nature.</em></strong> A shield guardian doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Bound</strong>: The shield guardian is magically bound to an amulet. As long as the guardian and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the amulet's wearer can telepathically call the guardian to travel to it, and the guardian knows the distance and direction to the amulet. If the guardian is within 60 feet of the amulet's wearer, half of any damage the wearer takes (rounded up) is transferred to the guardian.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Regeneration</strong>: The shield guardian regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit. point.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Spell Storing</strong>: A spellcaster who wears the shield guardian's amulet can cause the guardian to store one spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the wearer must cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is stored within the guardian. When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a situation arises that was predefined by the spellcaster, the guardian casts the stored spell with any parameters set by the original caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The guardian makes two fist attacks.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Fist</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Reactions</h2>\n\n<strong>Shield</strong>: When a creature makes an attack against the wearer of the guardian's amulet, the guardian grants a +2 bonus to the wearer's AC if the guardian is within 5 feet of the wearer.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-8a47a86d-01de-c429-3375-91c3d4f66c97\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Anytime she passes through the North Ward, Ulkoria (see archmage) stops by the tavern for a drink and to check out the place while her <b>shield guardian</b> waits outside.

Long ago humans and their ilk drove the kuo-toa underground, where they dwell in madness and everlasting night. Kuo-toa can no longer abide daylight.<br><br><strong><em><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26532514/R-xjzdAO6IobHivgfjaw2w/med.jpg?1482326474\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\">Mad Slaves.</em></strong> At the height of the illithid empire, the mind flayers captured kuo-toa by the thousands and forced them into bondage. The kuo-toa were simple creatures, never meant to endure the oppressive mental force the illithids unleashed against them. By the time the mind flayers abandoned them, the prolonged psychic subjugation endured by the kuo-toa had driven them mad.<br><br>Their minds shattered beyond repair, the kuo-toa adopted a religious fervor, inventing gods to protect them against threats. Most notable of these threats are the drow, which have slain the kuo-toa on sight since the days when the two races first met.<br><br><strong><em>God Makers.</em></strong> Kuo-toa worship gods of their own insane creation, but if enough kuo-toa believe that a god is real, the energy of their collective subconscious can cause that god to manifest as a physical entity. The form a kuo-toa god takes depends on the inspiration for its divine image, and is usually random or nonsensical.<br><br>One of the most revered gods of the kuo-toa is Blibdoolpoolp the Sea Mother, who takes the form of a female human with a crayfish head, a crayfish’s claws, and an articulated shell covering her shoulders. Blibdoolpoolp was likely invented by a kuo-toa that improved on a broken human statue by adding the limbs and head of a crustacean. In sudden awe of its handiwork, it then named the resulting form a god.<br><br>Kuo-toa that cross paths with an aboleth often find themselves worshiping it as a god, their madness blinding them to the fact that the aboleth is merely using them for its own nefarious ends.<br><br><strong><em>Theocratic Rulers.</em></strong> Kuo-toa archpriests are surrounded by fanatical devotees of their faith. The archpriest of a kuo-toa domain demands that all its subjects worship a specific god. An archpriest’s mad belief in its god is so fervent that it manifests the powers of a high cleric. The archpriest can also bestow spells to devout underlings called whips. One or more of these whips are also the archpriest’s children, and their primary role in kuo-toan society is to fight to the death to claim the throne when the archpriest dies. If a whip displeases the archpriest, the archpriest can strip it of its spellcasting ability, if not its life.<br><br>The archpriest’s decrees are enforced by monitors, devout kuo-toa that act as the archpriest’s eyes and ears. Monitors are deadly hand-to-hand combatants, and lesser kuo-toa live in fear of them.<br><br><strong><em>Kuo-toa Gear.</em></strong> Many weapons of the kuo-toa are designed to capture rather than kill. Nets are common, though some carry pincer staffs (also called mancatchers) designed to trap and immobilize foes. Kuo-toa warriors also treat their shields with a sticky goo that catches incoming weapons.<br><br>In general, kuo-toa don’t like the weight of armor on their slippery bodies and rely on their natural rubbery hides for protection. However, they like to wear jewelry made from scavenged bones, shells, pearls, gems, and carapace fragments.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Amphibious</strong>: The kuo-toa can breathe air and water.<br><br><strong>Otherworldly Perception</strong>: The kuo-toa can sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of it that is invisible or on the Ethereal Plane. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving.<br><br><strong>Slippery</strong>: The kuo-toa has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.<br><br><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity</strong>: While in sunlight, the kuo-toa has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Spear (Melee; One-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Spear (Melee; Two-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Spear (Ranged)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Net</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, range 5/15 ft., one Large or smaller creature. <em>Hit</em>: 0 (1d0) bludgeoning damage. The target is restrained. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check to free itself or another creature in a net, ending the effect on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net, AC 10, frees the target without harming it and destroys the net.<br><br><h2>Reactions</h2><strong>Sticky Shield</strong>: When a creature misses the kuo-toa with a melee weapon attack, the kuo-toa uses its sticky shield to catch the weapon. The attacker must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw, or the weapon becomes stuck to the kuo-toa’s shield. If the weapon’s wielder can’t or won’t let go of the weapon, the wielder is grappled while the weapon is stuck. While stuck, the weapon can’t be used. A creature can pull the weapon free by taking an action to make a DC 11 Strength check and succeeding.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">A kuo-toa whip and six <b>kuo-toa</b> guard the hall.

In dungeons, these cunning creatures most often take the form of doors and chests, having learned that such forms attract a steady stream of prey.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Imitative Predators.</em></strong> Mimics can alter their outward texture to resemble wood, stone, and other basic materials, and they have evolved to assume the appearance of objects that other creatures are likely to come into contact with. A mimic in its altered form is nearly unrecognizable until potential prey blunders into its reach, whereupon the monster sprouts pseudopods and attacks.<br><br>\n\tWhen it changes shape, a mimic excretes an adhesive that helps it seize prey and weapons that touch it. The adhesive is absorbed when the mimic assumes its amorphous form and on parts the mimic uses to move itself.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Cunning Hunters.</em></strong> Mimics live and hunt alone, though they occasionally share their feeding grounds with other creatures. Although most mimics have only predatory intelligence, a rare few evolve greater cunning and the ability to carry on simple conversations in Common or Undercommon. Such mimics might allow safe passage through their domains or provide useful information in exchange for food.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The mimic can use its action to polymorph into an object or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn 't transformed.

A form lurches into view, dragging one foot as it raises bloated arms and broken hands. The zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too slow to escape its grasp.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDark Servants.</em></strong> Sinister necromantic magic infuses the remains of the dead, causing them to rise as zombies that do their creator’s bidding without fear or hesitation. They move with a jerky, uneven gait, clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest, and carrying the stench of decay.<br><br>\n\tMost zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can’t be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell.<br><br>\n\tA zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHideous Forms.</em></strong> Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMindless Soldiers.</em></strong> Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.<br><br>\n\tA zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won’t retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUndead Nature.</em></strong> A zombie doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Undead Fortitude</strong>: If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Bite</strong>: Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Eye Ray</strong>: The zombie uses a random magical eye ray, choosing a target that it can see within 60 feet of it.<br><br>\n\t<div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">\n<strong>1.

Such terrifying cruelty. They are the vile poison that plagues all elvenkind.\"</em><br>—Nelar Autumnwell, elf cleric of Corellon Larethian</blockquote><br>\n\n<h2>Elves: Drow</h2>\nTens of thousands of years ago, the elves were divided, with those of benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves—the drow—found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26322810/Yh-mZ91x5frzYXZJ_Fp80Q/med.jpg?1481818797\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\"><strong><em>Children of Lolth.</em></strong> The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do.<br><br>\n\tThe wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCreatures of Darkness.</em></strong> The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUnderdark Cities.</em></strong> The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings.<br><br>\n\tA drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDrow Magic.</em></strong> Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tArms and Armor.</em></strong> Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCutthroat Politics.</em></strong> Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.<br><br>\n\tDrow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house’s social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMatriarchal Rule.</em></strong> Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.<br><br>\n\tIn drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow—either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can’t be priests, nor can they rule a house.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tPoison Predilection.</em></strong> Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Drow Mage</h2>\nPrivileged drow males who lack the strength and fighting prowess to train as warriors have no recourse but to pursue the study of magic. For them, it is a matter of survival. Female drow with a natural affinity for the arcane arts may also become drow mages, although they are much less common.<br><br>\n\n\n<br><br>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26322823/8Gl25c25yxM2iYr6A-q4iw/med.jpg?1481818847\"></div><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Fey Ancestry</strong>: The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.<br><br><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The drow's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: <br><br>• At will: <em>dancing lights</em><br>• 1/day each: <em>darkness</em>, <em>faerie fire</em>, <em>levitate</em> (self only)<br><br><strong>Spellcasting</strong>: The drow is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The drow has the following wizard spells prepared:<br><br>• Cantrips (at will): <em>mage hand</em>, <em>minor illusion</em>, <em>poison spray</em>, <em>ray of frost</em><br>• 1st level (4 slots): <em>mage armor</em>, <em>magic missile</em>, <em>shield</em>, <em>witch bolt</em><br>• 2nd level (3 slots): <em>alter self</em>, <em>misty step</em>, <em>web</em><br>• 3rd level (3 slots): <em>fly</em>, <em>lightning bolt</em><br>• 4th level (3 slots): <em>Evard’s black tentacles</em>, <em>greater invisibility</em><br>• 5th level (2 slots): <em>cloudkill</em><br><br><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity</strong>: While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Ray of Frost</strong>: <em>Ranged Spell Attack: </em>+6 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d8) cold damage and the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of the evoker's next turn.\n\n<br><br><strong>Staff (One-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 2 (1d6 - 1) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.\n\n<br><br><strong>Staff (Two-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 3 (1d8 - 1) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.\n\n<br><br><strong>Witch Bolt</strong>: <em>Ranged Spell Attack: </em>+6 to hit, range 30 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d12) lightning damage. On each of the drow's turns for the duration, the drow can use its action to deal 1d12 damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if the drow uses its action to do anything else, if the target is outside the spell's range, or if the target has total cover from the drow.<br><br><strong>Summon Demon (1/Day)</strong>: The drow magically summons a quasit, or attempts to summon a shadow demon with a 50 percent chance of success. The summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can’t summon other demons. It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Although Zardoz Zord (Jarlaxle Baenre) commands the fleet, each ship has its own captain: a Bregan D'aerthe <b>drow mage </b>disguised as a slender, well-dressed human.

The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.<br><br><strong><em>Lords of Tyranny.</em></strong> Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.<br><br>Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.<br><br><strong><em>Obedience and Ambition.</em></strong> In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.<br><br>At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.<br><br><strong><em>Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers.</em></strong> Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus’s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.<br><br>To own a creature’s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal’s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.<br><br><h2>The Infernal Hierarchy</h2>The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26111839/icO5Q3Fw_QzloxCpLG19pg/med.jpg?1481310510\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\">A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.<br><br>If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever—a fate that even Asmodeus fears.<br><br><strong><em>Archdevils.</em></strong> The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.<br><br><strong><em>Greater Devils.</em></strong> The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.<br><br><strong><em>Lesser Devils.</em></strong> The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Lemures.</em></strong> The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.<br><br><strong><em>Promotion and Demotion.</em></strong> When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil’s memories passing intact from one form to the next.<br><br>Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.<br><br><h3>Infernal Hierarchy</h3>1. lemure<br><br><strong>Lesser devils<br></strong>2. imp<br>3. spined devil<br>4. bearded devil<br>5. barbed devil<br>6. chain devil<br>7. bone devil<br><br><strong>Greater devils<br></strong>8. horned devil<br>9. erinyes<br>10. ice devil<br>11. pit fiend<br><br><strong>Archdevils<br></strong>12. duke or duchess<br>13. archduke or archduchess\n\n\n\t<br><br>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories—and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.<br><br>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other’s most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.<br><br><h3>The Nine Hells</h3>The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by archdevils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.<br><br><h2>Devil True Names and Talismans</h2>Though devils all have common names, every devil above a lemure in station also has a true name that it keeps secret. A devil can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the true names of certain devils.<br><br>\n\tA mortal who learns a devil’s true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the devil from the Nine Hells and bind it into service. Binding can also be accomplished with the help of a devil talisman. Each of these ancient relics is inscribed with the true name of a devil it controls, and was bathed in the blood of a worthy sacrifice—typically someone the creator loved—when crafted.<br><br>\n\tHowever it is summoned, a devil brought to the Material Plane typically resents being pressed into service. However, the devil seizes every opportunity to corrupt its summoner so that the summoner’s soul ends up in the Nine Hells. Only imps are truly content to be summoned, and they easily commit to serving a summoner as a familiar, but they still do their utmost to corrupt those who summon them.\n\n\n<br><br><h2>Imp</h2>Imps are found throughout the Lower Planes, either running errands for their infernal masters, spying on rivals, or misleading and waylaying mortals. An imp will proudly serve an evil master of any kind, but it can’t be relied on to carry out tasks with any speed or efficiency.<br><br>\n\tAn imp can assume animal form at will, but in its natural state it resembles a diminutive red-skinned humanoid with a barbed tail, small horns, and leathery wings. It strikes while invisible, attacking with its poison stinger.<br><br>\n\n\n<h3>Variant: Imp Familiar</h3>Imps can be found in the service to mortal spellcasters, acting as advisors, spies, and familiars. An imp urges its master to acts of evil, knowing the mortal’s soul is a prize the imp might ultimately claim. Imps display an unusual loyalty to their masters, and an imp can be quite dangerous if its master is threatened. Some such imps have the following trait.<br><br>\n\tFamiliar. The imp can enter into a contract to serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the imp senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the imp is within 10 feet of its master, the master shares the imp’s Magic Resistance trait. If its master violates the terms of the contract, the imp can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.<br><br>\n\n<h3>Layers and the Lords of the Nine Hells</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Layer</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Layer Name</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Archduke or Archduchess</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Previous Rulers</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Primary Inhabitants</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n1\n</td>\n<td>\nAvernus\n</td>\n<td>\nZariel\n</td>\n<td>\nBel, Tiamat\n</td>\n<td>\nErinyes, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n2\n</td>\n<td>\nDis\n</td>\n<td>\nDispater\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBearded devils, erinyes, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n3\n</td>\n<td>\nMinauros\n</td>\n<td>\nMammon\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBearded devils, chain devils, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n4\n</td>\n<td>\nPhlegethos\n</td>\n<td>\nBelial and Fierna\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n5\n</td>\n<td>\nStygia\n</td>\n<td>\nLevistus\n</td>\n<td>\nGeryon\n</td>\n<td>\nBone devils, erinyes, ice devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n6\n</td>\n<td>\nMalbolge\n</td>\n<td>\nGlasya\n</td>\n<td>\nMalagard, Moloch\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n7\n</td>\n<td>\nMaladomini\n</td>\n<td>\nBaalzebul\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n8\n</td>\n<td>\nCania\n</td>\n<td>\nMephistopheles\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nHorned devils, ice devils, imps, pit fiends\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n9\n</td>\n<td>\nNessus\n</td>\n<td>\nAsmodeus\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nAll devils&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The imp can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that resembles a rat (speed 20 ft.), a raven (20 ft., fly 60 ft.), or a spider (20 ft., climb 20 ft.), or back into its true form.

Valetta doesn't recognize the lock or have a key to open it, but a character using thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A knock spell or similar magic also opens the door. Valetta won't allow characters to break down the door, but she does permit them to speak to Nim through the door.

A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator’s orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.<br><br>\n\tTo create a golem, one requires a <em>manual of golems</em> (see the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tElemental Spirit in Material Form.</em></strong> The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem’s creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.<br><br>\n\tAfter constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem’s creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem’s creator.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAgeless Guardians.</em></strong> Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.<br><br>\n\tA golems can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tBlind Obedience.</em></strong> When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can’t fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently—or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.<br><br>\n\tA golem can’t think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can’t be reasoned with or tricked with words.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tConstructed Nature.</em></strong> A golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<em>\"Two of my gravediggers were caught and hanged yesterday. The other two are understandably reluctant to meet a similar fate, but I shan’t let their concerns stall my progress. I need fresh corpses, and if those bumpkins can’t get them for me, I’ll use theirs instead.\"</em><br>—From the diary of Evangeliza Lavain, necromancer</blockquote>\n<br>\n\n\n<h2>Flesh Golem</h2>\nA flesh golem is a grisly assortment of humanoid body parts stitched and bolted together into a muscled brute imbued with formidable strength. Its brain is capable of simple reason, though its thoughts are no more sophisticated than those of a young child. The golem’s muscle tissue responds to the power of lightning, invigorating the creature with vitality and strength. Powerful enchantments protect the golem’s skin, deflecting spells and all but the most potent weapons.<br><br>\n\tA flesh golem lurches with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body. Its dead flesh isn’t an ideal container for an elemental spirit, which sometimes howls incoherently to vent its outrage. If the spirit breaks free of its creator’s will, the golem goes berserk until calmed, or until its shell of flesh is destroyed or completely healed.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n<strong>Berserk</strong>: Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.<br><br>The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.<br><br><strong>Aversion of Fire</strong>: If the golem takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.<br><br><strong>Immutable Form</strong>: The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.<br><br><strong>Lightning Absorption</strong>: Whenever the golem is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.<br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><strong>Magic Weapons</strong>: The golem's weapon attacks are magical.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The golem makes two slam attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral","race":"","type":"construct","environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["lightning","poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","exhaustion","frightened","paralyzed","petrified","poisoned"],"custom":""},"senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"passive":7},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"passive":7},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"passive":7},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"passive":7},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NmU5YzIxZWRkN2Yx","sort":1950000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/195_-_Flesh_Golem/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Flesh Golem","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/195_-_Flesh_Golem/token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"MjcyOWI1YTY3ZDVh","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":93,"max":93},"bar2":{"value":9,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"ZDBhNDIxNzQ4Njcz","flags":{},"name":"Berserk.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/195_-_Flesh_Golem/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6.

Kobolds inhabit dragons’ lairs when they can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tStrength in Numbers.</em></strong> Kobolds are egg-laying creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be “great wyrms” more than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can win battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties on the kobold side.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTunnelers and Builders.</em></strong> Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels through which they move easily but which hinder larger humanoids. Kobolds also riddle their lairs with traps. The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural hazards and other creatures. A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh-eating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant centipedes at intruders.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tThe Lost God.</em></strong> In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat’s vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen’s hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak’s most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWinged Kobolds.</em></strong> A few kobolds are born with leathery wings and can fly. Known as urds, they like to lurk on high ledges and drop rocks on passersby.

The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves—the drow—found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26322810/Yh-mZ91x5frzYXZJ_Fp80Q/med.jpg?1481818797\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\"><strong><em>Children of Lolth.</em></strong> The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do.<br><br>\n\tThe wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCreatures of Darkness.</em></strong> The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUnderdark Cities.</em></strong> The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings.<br><br>\n\tA drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDrow Magic.</em></strong> Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tArms and Armor.</em></strong> Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCutthroat Politics.</em></strong> Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.<br><br>\n\tDrow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house’s social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMatriarchal Rule.</em></strong> Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.<br><br>\n\tIn drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow—either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can’t be priests, nor can they rule a house.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tPoison Predilection.</em></strong> Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.<br><br>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26322823/8Gl25c25yxM2iYr6A-q4iw/med.jpg?1481818847\"></div><br>\n\n<h2>Variant: Drow Magic Armor and Weapons</h2>\nDrow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.<br><br>\n\tA <strong>drow</strong> wearing a <em>+1 chain shirt</em> and carrying a <em>+1 shortsword</em> has AC 19 and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.<br><br>\n\tA <strong>drow elite warrior</strong> wearing <em>+2 studded leather</em> and carrying a <em>+2 shortsword</em> has AC 20 and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.<br><br>\n\tA <strong>drow priestess of Lolth</strong> wearing <em>+3 scale mail</em> has AC 19.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Fey Ancestry</strong>: The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.<br><br><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The drow's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 11).

Few creatures spread fear, suspicion, and deceit better than doppelgangers. Found in every land and culture, they can take on the guise of any individual of any race.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tStealing Secrets.</em></strong> A doppelganger’s adopted form allows it to blend into almost any group or community, but its transformation doesn’t impart languages, mannerisms, memory, or personality. Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature’s surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature’s name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger impersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and close at hand for weeks, probing the victim’s mind daily to learn how to behave and speak authentically.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHedonistic Swindlers.</em></strong> Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con to con. While one doppelganger takes the place of a murdered merchant or noble, the others take on a number of identities as circumstances warrant, playing the parts of family or servants while they live off the victim’s riches.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tChangelings.</em></strong> Doppelgangers are too lazy or self-interested to raise their young. They assume attractive male forms and seduce women, leaving them to raise their progeny. A doppelganger child appears to be a normal member of its mother’s species until it reaches adolescence, at which point it discovers its true nature and is driven to seek out its kind to join them.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br><strong>Ambusher</strong>: In the first round of a combat, the doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.<br><br><strong>Surprise Attack</strong>: If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Read Thoughts</strong>: The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.<br></p>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><i>“Many adventurers pass though the Yawning Portal on their way to greatness.

In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.<br><br>\n\tEvil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCurse of Lycanthropy.</em></strong> A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A <em>remove curse</em> spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish.<br><br>\n\tA lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form—or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.<br><br>\n\tSome individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Wererat</h2>\nWererats are cunning lycanthropes with sly, avaricious personalities. They are wiry and twitchy in humanoid form, with thin hair and darting eyes. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, wererats prefer light weapons and use ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although a wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form, it favors that form for stealthy infiltration and escape rather than combat.<br><br>\n\tA wererat clan operates much like a thieves’ guild, with wererats transmitting their curse only to creatures they want to induct into the clan. Wererats that are accidentally cursed or break loose from the clan’s control are quickly hunted down and killed.<br><br>\n\tWererat clans are found throughout urban civilization, often dwelling in cellars and catacombs. These creatures are common in the sewers beneath major cities, viewing those subterranean areas as their hunting grounds. Rats and giant rats are commonly found living among wererats.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Variant: Nonhuman Lycanthropes</h2>\nThe statistics presented in this section assume a base creature of human. However, you can also use the statistics to represent nonhuman lycanthropes, adding verisimilitude by allowing a nonhuman lycanthrope to retain one or more of its humanoid racial traits. For example, an elf werewolf might have the Fey Ancestry trait.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Player Characters as Lycanthropes</h2>\nA character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics except as specified by lycanthrope type. The character gains the lycanthrope’s speeds in nonhumanoid form, damage immunities, traits, and actions that don’t involve equipment. The character is proficient with the lycanthrope’s natural attacks, such as its bite or claws, which deal damage as shown in the lycanthrope’s statistics. The character can’t speak while in animal form.<br><br>\n\tA humanoid hit by an attack that carries the curse of lycanthropy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + the lycanthrope’s proficiency bonus + the lycanthrope’s Constitution modifier) or be cursed. If the character embraces the curse, his or her alignment becomes the one defined for the lycanthrope. The DM is free to decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control until the curse of lycanthropy is removed.<br><br>\n\tThe following information applies to specific lycanthropes.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWerebear.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of 19 if his or her score isn’t already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while in bear or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for the natural weapons are based on Strength.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWereboar.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of 17 if his or her score isn’t already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while in boar or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for the tusks are based on Strength. For the Charge trait, the DC is 8 + the character’s proficiency bonus + Strength modifier.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWererat.</em></strong> The character gains a Dexterity of 15 if his or her score isn’t already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the bite are based on whichever is higher of the character’s Strength and Dexterity.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWeretiger.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of 17 if his or her score isn’t already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the natural weapons are based on Strength. For the Pounce trait, the DC is 8 + the character’s proficiency bonus + Strength modifier.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWerewolf.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of 15 if his or her score isn’t already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while in wolf or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for the natural weapons are based on Strength.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The wererat can use its action to polymorph into a rat-humanoid hybrid or into a giant rat, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br><strong>Keen Smell</strong>: The wererat has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only)</strong>: The wererat makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite.<br><br><strong>Bite (Rat or Hybrid Form Only).</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

Aggressive, hateful, and greedy, these aberrations dismiss all other creatures as lesser beings, toying with them or destroying them as they choose.<br><br>A beholder’s spheroid body levitates at all times, and its great bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw, while the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and turn to keep its foes in sight. When a beholder sleeps, it closes its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes open and alert.<br><br><strong><em>Xenophobic Isolationists.</em></strong> Enemies abound, or so every beholder believes. Beholders are convinced that other creatures resent them for their brilliance and magical power, even as they dismiss those lesser creatures as crude and disgusting. Beholders always suspect others of plotting against them, even when no other creatures are around.<br><br>The disdain a beholder has for other creatures extends to other beholders. Each beholder believes its form to be an ideal, and that any deviation from that form is a flaw in the racial purity of its kind. Beholders vary greatly in their physical forms, making conflict between them inevitable. Some beholders are protected by overlapping chitinous plates. Some have smooth hides. Some have eyestalks that writhe like tentacles, while others’ stalks bear crustacean-like joints. Even slight differences of coloration in hide can turn two beholders into lifelong enemies.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/25981067/gFNe0L09lZdJhwcvN-Z7Pw/med.jpg?1480962559\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\"><strong><em>Eye Tyrant.</em></strong> Some beholders manage to channel their xenophobic tendencies into a terrible despotism. Rather than live in isolation, the aptly named eye tyrants enslave those other creatures, founding and controlling vast empires. An eye tyrant sometimes carves out a domain within or under a major city, commanding networks of agents that operate on their master’s behalf.<br><br><strong><em>Alien Lairs.</em></strong> Because they refuse to share territory with others, most beholders withdraw to frigid hills, abandoned ruins, and deep caverns to scheme. A beholder’s lair is carved out by its disintegration eye ray, emphasizing vertical passages connecting chambers stacked on top of each other. Such an environment allows a beholder to move freely, even as it prevents intruders from easily creeping about. When intruders do break in, the height of its open ceilings allows a beholder to float up and harry foes on the floor.<br><br>As alien as their creator, the rooms in a beholder’s lair reflect the creature’s arrogance. It festoons its chambers with trophies from the battles it has won, including petrified adventurers standing frozen in their horrified final moments, pieces of other beholders, and magic items wrested from powerful foes. A beholder judges its own worth by its acquisitions, and it never willingly parts with its treasures.<br><br><h2>A Beholder’s Lair</h2>A beholder’s central lair is typically a large, spacious cavern with high ceilings, where it can attack without fear of closing to melee range. A beholder encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 14 (11,500 XP).<br><br><h3>Lair Actions</h3>When fighting inside its lair, a beholder can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the beholder can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:<br><br><ul>\n<li>A 50-foot square area of ground within 120 feet of the beholder becomes slimy; that area is difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>\n<li>Walls within 120 feet of the beholder sprout grasping appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Each creature of the beholder’s choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of such a wall must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</li>\n<li>An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of the beholder. One random eye ray of the beholder shoots from that eye at a target of the beholder’s choice that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears.</li>\n</ul><br>The beholder can’t repeat an effect until they have all been used, and it can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.<br><br><h3>Regional Effects</h3>A region containing a beholder’s lair is warped by the creature’s unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:<br><br><ul>\n<li>Creatures within 1 mile of the beholder’s lair sometimes feel as if they’re being watched when they aren’t.</li>\n<li>When the beholder sleeps, minor warps in reality occur within 1 mile of its lair and then vanish 24 hours later. Marks on cave walls might change subtly, an eerie trinket might appear where none existed before, harmless slime might coat a statue, and so on. These effects apply only to natural surfaces and to nonmagical objects that aren’t on anyone’s person.</li>\n</ul><br>If the beholder dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Antimagic Cone</strong>: The beholder’s central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the <em>antimagic field</em> spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the beholder’s own eye rays.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 14 (4d6) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Eye Rays</strong>: The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">\n<strong>1. Charm Ray</strong>: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.<br><strong>2. Paralyzing Ray</strong>: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><strong>3. Fear Ray</strong>: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><strong>4. Slowing Ray</strong>: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can’t take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><strong>5. Enervation Ray</strong>: The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><strong>6. Telekinetic Ray</strong>: If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray’s telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder’s next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn’t being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.<br><strong>7. Sleep Ray</strong>: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.<br><strong>8. Petrification Ray</strong>: The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.<br><strong>9. Disintegration Ray</strong>: If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.\n\tIf the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.<br><strong>10. Death Ray</strong>: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.</div><br><h2>Legendary Actions</h2>The beholder can take 3 legendary actions, using the Eye Ray option below. It can take only one legendary action at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The beholder regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.<br><br><strong>Eye Ray</strong>: The beholder uses one random eye ray.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><b>Xanathar </b>is a paranoid, megalomaniacal beholder crime lord whose goal is to wipe out anyone it perceives as a Zhentarim operative or sympathizer, retrieve the Stone of Golorr, and secure the cache of dragons. Its base is a dungeon under Skullport, a subterranean settlement beneath Waterdeep.<br></span><br>Xanathar has a healthy fear of Laeral Silverhand and is inclined to spare those in her employ, to avoid provoking a conflict with Waterdeep's Open Lord. Adventurers who incur the wrath of the beholder can use its fear of Laeral to escape certain death.<br><br>If you choose Xanathar as the villain, the adventure takes place in the spring.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br>Xanathar is the name given to the beholder crime lord that lives in the dungeons under Waterdeep. It isn't the first beholder to claim this mantle, nor will it be the last.<br></span><br>Like all beholders, Xanathar is a paranoid tyrant that charms and bullies its minions into servitude. The Xanathar Guild is made up of some of Waterdeep's most disreputable folk, as well as monsters forced into subservience or drawn to the beholder by the promise of treasure, food, or power. Treachery within the ranks of the guild is common as servants vie for the beholder's favor and affection. Such boons are fleeting, though, as the beholder is quick to distrust those who finagle their way into its good graces.<br><br>Xanathar lives in a dungeon under Skullport, a subterranean settlement connected to Undermountain's third level. The place resembles a ramshackle town, built inside a giant cavern connected to an underground river. Members of the Xanathar Guild haunt Skullport's dilapidated buildings, and flameskulls patrol its streets.<br><br>The only creature Xanathar truly cares about aside from itself is a fish, named Sylgar, that it keeps in a large glass tank. Xanathar has minions that look after the fish constantly, but even their ministrations can't keep such a creature alive forever. Whenever the fish dies, panic spreads through the occupants of the lair as minions try to replace the fish before Xanathar realizes what has happened. Luckily for them, the beholder can't tell one fish from another.<br><br>Xanathar is extremely fond of gold. A few years ago, its spies stole the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>, which contained information that led to the discovery of a dwarven vault under Waterdeep. Xanathar was able to open the vault, but was forced out by the dragon inside the place. Recently, someone stole the <i>Stone of Golorr</i> from where it was hidden inside its lair, and the beholder is convinced that the Black Network is behind the theft.<br><br>The beholder is caught up in the unbreakable grip of its own paranoia. It sees enemies everywhere, and lashes out at anyone it suspects of being a Zhentarim spy or assassin. Adventurers who attract its attention by dealing with known or suspected Black Network operatives are quickly branded as enemies that must be destroyed.</p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Evil","race":"","type":"aberration","environment":"","cr":13,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10000},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["prone"],"custom":""},"senses":"darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 22","languages":{"value":["deep","undercommon"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":12,"passive":22},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":1,"max":1},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":true,"initiative":20}}},"folder":"NTdhYjI5OGI4MzZm","sort":1480000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/148_-_Xanathar/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Xanathar","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/148_-_Xanathar/token.png","tint":null,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":130,"brightSight":120,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"MzMyNGExNTJhZjA2","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":180,"max":180},"bar2":{"value":18,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"MDI0MjJiY2M4NjM2","flags":{},"name":"Antimagic Cone.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/148_-_Xanathar/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The beholder’s central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot cone.

The warriors of the court selectively bred the beasts to reinforce their ferocious and predatory nature, using them to hunt unicorns, pegasi, and other wondrous prey. However, it didn’t take long for the displacer beasts to use their malevolent intelligence to escape their masters.<br><br>Running and breeding freely in the Feywild, the displacer beasts soon came to the attention of the Seelie Court. With blink dog companions at their side, fey hunters drove these predators to the fringes of the Feywild, where many crossed over to the Material Plane. To this day, displacer beasts and blink dogs attack each other on sight.<br><br><strong><em>Love of the Kill.</em></strong> Displacer beasts kill not just for food but also for sport. They target prey even when not hungry, often toying with their victims to entertain themselves until they are ready to eat. After killing its prey using its tentacles, a displacer beast drags the corpse to a quiet place where it can feed without distraction.<br><br>Displacer beasts hunt alone or in small prides that demonstrate skill at setting ambushes. A single beast will strike and withdraw, luring prey into a densely wooded area where its packmates wait. Packs of displacer beasts hunting near trade roads recall the frequency and schedule of regular caravans, laying down ambushes to pick off those caravans.<br><br><strong><em>Prized Guards and Pets.</em></strong> Intelligent evil creatures favor displacer beasts as pets, but a displacer beast enters such an alliance only if it appears beneficial. A displacer beast might guard a vault or act as a bodyguard for a prominent individual.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Avoidance</strong>: If the displacer beast is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.<br><br><strong>Displacement</strong>: The displacer beast projects a magical illusion that makes it appear to be standing near its actual location, causing attack rolls against it to have disadvantage. If it is hit by an attack, this trait is disrupted until the end of its next turn. This trait is also disrupted while the displacer beast is incapacitated or has a speed of 0.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The displacer beast makes two attacks with its tentacles.<br><br><strong>Tentacle</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) piercing damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-4164031e-fd4b-5229-dad9-397b634bd678\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Kalain spends most of her time in area W5, which serves as her studio.

In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.<br><br>\n\t<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26538117/XDa-tKk2lB0yjcsCjppFsA/med.jpg?1482341788\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\">Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCurse of Lycanthropy.</em></strong> A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A <em>remove curse</em> spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish.<br><br>\n\tA lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form—or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.<br><br>\n\tSome individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Werewolf</h2>\nA werewolf is a savage predator. In its humanoid form, a werewolf has heightened senses, a fiery temper, and a tendency to eat rare meat. Its wolf form is a fearsome predator, but its hybrid form is more terrifying by far—a furred and well-muscled humanoid body topped by a ravening wolf’s head. A werewolf can wield weapons in hybrid form, though it prefers to tear foes apart with its powerful claws and bite.<br><br>\n\tMost werewolves flee civilized lands not long after becoming afflicted. Those that reject the curse fear what will happen if they remain among their friends and family. Those that embrace the curse fear discovery and the consequences of their murderous acts. In the wild, werewolves form packs that also include wolves and dire wolves.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Variant: Nonhuman Lycanthropes</h2>\nThe statistics presented in this section assume a base creature of human. However, you can also use the statistics to represent nonhuman lycanthropes, adding verisimilitude by allowing a nonhuman lycanthrope to retain one or more of its humanoid racial traits. For example, an elf werewolf might have the Fey Ancestry trait.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Player Characters as Lycanthropes</h2>\nA character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics except as specified by lycanthrope type. The character gains the lycanthrope’s speeds in nonhumanoid form, damage immunities, traits, and actions that don’t involve equipment. The character is proficient with the lycanthrope’s natural attacks, such as its bite or claws, which deal damage as shown in the lycanthrope’s statistics. The character can’t speak while in animal form.<br><br>\n\tA humanoid hit by an attack that carries the curse of lycanthropy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + the lycanthrope’s proficiency bonus + the lycanthrope’s Constitution modifier) or be cursed. If the character embraces the curse, his or her alignment becomes the one defined for the lycanthrope. The DM is free to decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control until the curse of lycanthropy is removed.<br><br>\n\tThe following information applies to specific lycanthropes.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWerebear.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of 19 if his or her score isn’t already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while in bear or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for the natural weapons are based on Strength.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWereboar.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of 17 if his or her score isn’t already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while in boar or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for the tusks are based on Strength. For the Charge trait, the DC is 8 + the character’s proficiency bonus + Strength modifier.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWererat.</em></strong> The character gains a Dexterity of 15 if his or her score isn’t already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the bite are based on whichever is higher of the character’s Strength and Dexterity.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWeretiger.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of 17 if his or her score isn’t already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the natural weapons are based on Strength. For the Pounce trait, the DC is 8 + the character’s proficiency bonus + Strength modifier.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWerewolf.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of 15 if his or her score isn’t already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while in wolf or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for the natural weapons are based on Strength.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The werewolf can use its action to polymorph into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid.

They survive by virtue of their stealth, cleverness, and tenacity. Their gray skin allows them to blend in with surrounding stonework. They are also surprisingly heavy and strong for their size. An average adult weighs 100 to 120 pounds and stands 3 feet tall.<br><br>\n\tA typical svirfneblin enclave contains several hundred deep gnomes and is strongly fortified. Secret tunnels lead to and from the settlement, and the deep gnomes use these as evacuation routes when the enclave comes under attack.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tEstablished Gender Roles.</em></strong> Male svirfneblin are bald, while females have stringy gray hair. Traditionally, females run the enclaves while males scour the outskirts in search of enemies and deposits of precious gemstones.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tGemstone Harvesters.</em></strong> Svirfneblin cherish fine gemstones, especially rubies, which they harvest from mines deep in the Underdark. The hunt for gems often brings them into conflict with beholders, drow, kuo-toa, duergar, and mind flayers. Of all their natural enemies, deep gnomes fear and despise the murderous, demon-worshiping drow the most.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tEarth Friends.</em></strong> Deep gnomes are often encountered in the company of creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth. Some svirfneblin can summon such creatures. Earth creatures guard svirfneblin settlements, especially xorn enticed to service with the promise of gems to feed on.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Stone Camouflage</strong>: The gnome has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) \nchecks made to hide in rocky terrain.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Gnome Cunning</strong>: The gnome has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The gnome's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 11).

Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection.

In fact, at least three are still alive. The one presently in Waterdeep escaped death by hiding out in Undermountain, where he eventually ran afoul of Halaster Blackcloak. After a brief spell duel, Halaster captured Manshoon and amputated his left arm at the elbow for reasons unknown. Manshoon escaped imprisonment and fled Undermountain, taking refuge in the city above.

If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration.

If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.

While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target. When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment. Burial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb. Chaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal. Hedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade. Minimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby. Slumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs. Ending the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points. A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it. You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"minute","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"perm"},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":30,"long":"","units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":9,"school":"abj","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"A vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target","consumed":false,"cost":500,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":310000},{"_id":"YmEzZjVjNmI3MWU1","flags":{},"name":"Power Word Kill","type":"spell","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/rip-jade-3.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly.

A gargoyle lurks among masonry and ruins, as still as any stone sculpture, and delights in the terror it creates when it breaks from its suspended pose, as well as the pain it inflicts on its victims.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAnimate Stone.</em></strong> Gargoyles cling to rocky cliffs and mountains, or roost on ledges in underground caves. They haunt city rooftops, perching vulture-like among the high stone arches and buttresses of castles and cathedrals, and they can hold themselves so still that they appear inanimate. Able to maintain this state for years, a gargoyle makes an ideal sentry.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDeadly Reputation.</em></strong> Gargoyles have a reputation for cruelty. Statues carved into the likenesses of gargoyles appear in the architecture of countless cultures to frighten away trespassers. Although such sculptures are only decorative, real gargoyles can hide among them to ambush unsuspecting victims. A gargoyle might alleviate the tedium of its watch by catching and tormenting birds or rodents, but its long wait only increases its craving for harming sentient creatures.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCruel Servants.</em></strong> Gargoyles are easily inspired by the cunning of an intelligent master. They enjoy simple tasks such as guarding a master’s home, torturing and killing interlopers, and anything else that involves minimum effort and maximum pain and carnage.<br><br>\n\tGargoyles sometimes serve demons for their propensity for wanton chaos and destruction. Powerful spellcasters can also easily enlist gargoyle guardians to keep watch over their gates and walls. Gargoyles have the patience and fortitude of stone, and will serve even the cruelest master for years without complaint.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tElemental Nature.</em></strong> A gargoyle doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Shards of Elemental Evil</h2>\nAs Ogrémoch, the evil Prince of Elemental Earth, treads his stony realm, it leaves shards of broken rock in his wake. Imbued with slivers of sentience, these shards thrum with the essence of the elemental prince, growing over long years into vaguely humanoid rock formations that resolve at last into the hard, cruel shapes of gargoyles.<br><br>\n\tOgrémoch doesn’t create gargoyles deliberately, but they are a physical manifestation of his evil. Gargoyles are mockeries of the elemental air that Ogrémoch despises. They are heavy creatures of living stone, yet capable of flight. Like their creator, they possess a fundamental hatred for beings of elemental air, aarakocra in particular, and relish every opportunity to destroy such creatures.<br><br>\n\tOn their home plane, gargoyles carve out earth motes that Ogrémoch hurtles into Aaqa, the domain of the aarakocra and the benevolent Wind Dukes the bird folk serve in the Elemental Plane of Air.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>False Appearance</strong>: While the gargoyle remains motion less, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate statue.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The gargoyle makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Claws</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Area K4 is a musty room situated at the bottom of the main tower, and it has no door on level 1.&nbsp;</span>Tomes are packed into built-in stone bookshelves, with a tall alcove above each shelf holding a gargoyle.

When the undead flameskull discovers trespassers, it blasts the intruders with fiery rays from its eyes and dreadful spells called up from the dark recesses of its memory.<br><br>Dark spellcasters fashion flameskulls from the remains of dead wizards. When the ritual is complete, green flames erupt from the skull to complete its ghastly transformation.<br><br><strong><em>Legacy of Life.</em></strong> A flameskull only dimly recalls its former life. Though it might speak in its old voice and recount key events from its past, it is but an echo of its former self. However, its undead transformation grants it full access to the magic it wielded in life, letting it cast spells while ignoring the material and somatic components it can no longer employ.<br><br><strong><em>Eternally Bound.</em></strong> Intelligent and vigilant, a flameskull serves its creator by protecting a hidden treasure hoard, a secret chamber, or a specific individual. A flameskull carries out the directives given to it when it was created, and it interprets those commands to the letter. A flameskull’s master must craft its instructions with care to ensure that the creature carries out its tasks properly.<br><br><strong><em>Wreathed in Flame.</em></strong> The fire wreathing a flameskull burns continually, giving off bright light that the creature controls. It uses those flames as a weapon, focusing them to loose them as fiery rays from its eye sockets.<br><br><strong><em>Eldritch Rejuvenation.</em></strong> A flameskull’s shattered fragments reform unless they are splashed with holy water or subjected to a dispel magic or remove curse spell. If it can no longer fulfill its intended purpose, the re-formed flameskull is beholden to no one and becomes autonomous.<br><br><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A flameskull doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Illumination</strong>: The flameskull sheds either dim light in a 15-foot radius, or bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. It can switch between the options as an action.<br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The flameskull has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><strong>Rejuvenation</strong>: If the flameskull is destroyed, it regains all its hit points in 1 hour unless holy water is sprinkled on its remains or a dispel magic or remove curse spell is cast on them.<br><br><strong>Spellcasting</strong>: The flameskull is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no somatic or material components to cast its spells. The flameskull has the following wizard spells prepared:<br><br>• Cantrip (at will): <em>mage hand</em><br>• 1st level (3 slots): <em>magic missile</em>, <em>shield</em><br>• 2nd level (2 slots): <em>blur</em>, <em>flaming sphere</em><br>• 3rd level (1 slot): <em>fireball</em><br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The flameskull uses Fire Ray twice.<br><br><strong>Fire Ray</strong>: <em>Ranged Spell Attack</em>: +5 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 10 (3d6) fire damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">A <b>flameskull </b>bobs in the middle of the room in area K19, which is choked with dust and cobwebs.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Manshoon found Duhlark Kolat's skeletal remains in the bed and transformed his skull into a flameskull.

He leaves most of the plotting and socializing to his wife, Yalah, to whom he is devoted.<br></span><br>When several of the Masked Lords were assassinated in quick succession some years ago, Lord Gralhund had expected his wife to fill one of the vacancies. That never happened, though, despite many promises and bribes. After she was passed over, Orond became insanely angry, and he has remained that way ever since.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><br>Less than a year ago, the Gralhunds were approached by agents of the Zhentarim loyal to Manshoon, and the nobles formed an alliance with them. House Gralhund gives the Zhents coin and allows them to use the family's noble villa as a refuge. In exchange, the house reaps all the benefits that the Black Network offers, including intelligence that its spies have gathered. So while the Zhents use House Gralhund as a shield, the Gralhunds are using the Zhents to ascertain the identities and weaknesses of the Masked Lords.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><br>Orond doesn't fully grasp how entwined the Black Network and his family have become—it is now next to impossible to separate one from the other. It's no secret in Waterdeep that the Black Network has firmly rooted itself in House Gralhund. But what's not generally known is that the Zhents in House Gralhund are agents of Manshoon. Neither Orond nor any other member of his family knows about the wizard's clone. As far as Orond and his wife are concerned, the local leaders of the Black Network (with Urstul Floxin chief among them) reside with them in the family villa.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><br>Orond is a short, stocky man who dresses well and is easy on the eyes. When he opens his mouth, his boorish nature, inflated sense of self-importance, fragile ego, and despicable opinions about “the common rabble” come to the fore, and his charm quickly dissipates. When not in his wife's company, he is prone to excessive boasting and temper tantrums. When he must speak to strangers, he keeps his half-orc bodyguard Hrabbaz close by, for fear that others might attack and rob him at any moment. While in Yalah's presence, Orond becomes an altogether different person: quiet, almost timid, and happy to let his wife have the spotlight.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><br>Orond relies on Yalah to manage the Zhentarim. He spends his days watching mercenaries train, paying bills, and ranting about the cost of doing business in the city. Although he is human, Orond was born with a tiefling's tail. The tail was amputated when he was a young boy, but the scar on his backside remains.</p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":"","type":"humanoid (human)","environment":"","cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"passive Perception 12","languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"per":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NTdhYjI5OGI4MzZm","sort":1350000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/135_-_Orond_Gralhund/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Orond Gralhund","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/135_-_Orond_Gralhund/token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":5,"brightSight":5,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"NDE0NTFkOTMyMzMw","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":9,"max":9},"bar2":{"value":15,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"OTFkYzNjMWY1Yzkz","flags":{},"name":"Parry.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/135_-_Orond_Gralhund/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The noble adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it.

Psionic tyrants, slavers, and interdimensional voyagers, they are insidious masterminds that harvest entire races for their own twisted ends. Four tentacles snake from their octopus-like heads, flexing in hungry anticipation when sentient creatures come near.<br><br>\n\tIn eons past, illithids controlled empires that spanned many worlds. They subjugated and consequently warped whole races of humanoid slaves, including the githyanki and githzerai, the grimlocks, and the kuo-toa. Conjoined by a collective consciousness, the illithids hatch plots as far-reaching and evil as their fathomless minds can conceive.<br><br>\n\tSince the fall of their empires, illithid collectives on the Material Plane have resided in the Underdark.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Psionic Commanders.</em></strong> Mind flayers possess psionic powers that enable them to control the minds of creatures such as troglodytes, grimlocks, quaggoths, and ogres. Illithids prefer to communicate via telepathy and use their telepathy when issuing commands to their thralls.<br><br>\n\tWhen an illithid meets strong resistance, it avoids initial combat as it orders its thralls to attack. Like physical extensions of the illithid’s thoughts, these thralls interpose themselves between the mind flayer and its foes, sacrificing their lives so that their master can escape.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Hive Mind Colonies.</em></strong> Solitary mind flayers are likely rogues and outcasts. Most illithids belong to a colony of sibling mind flayers devoted to an elder brain—a massive brain-like being that resides in a briny pool near the center of a mind flayer community. From its pool, an elder brain telepathically dictates its desires to each individual mind flayer within 5 miles of it, for it is able to hold multiple mental conversations at once.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Hunger of the Mind.</em></strong> Illithids subsist on the brains of humanoids. The brains provide enzymes, hormones, and psychic energy necessary for their survival. An illithid healthy from a brain-rich diet secretes a thin glaze of mucus that coats its mauve skin.<br><br>\n\tAn illithid experiences euphoria as it devours the brain of a humanoid, along with its memories, personality, and innermost fears. Mind flayers will sometimes harvest a brain rather than devour it, using it as part of some alien experiment or transforming it into an intellect devourer.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Qualith</h2>\nOn the rare occasion that mind flayers need to write something down, they do so in Qualith. This system of tactile writing (similar to braille) is read by an illithid’s tentacles. Qualith is written in four-line stanzas and is so alien in construction that non-illithids must resort to magic to discern its meaning. Though Qualith can be used to keep records, illithids most often use it to mark portals or other surfaces with warnings or instructions.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The mind flayer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Innate Spellcasting (Psionics)</strong>: The mind flayer’s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:<br><br>\n• At will: <em>detect thoughts, levitate</em><br>\n• 1/day each: <em>dominate monster, plane shift </em>(self only)<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Tentacles</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (2d10 + 4) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled, escape DC 15, and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this grapple ends.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Extract Brain</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated humanoid grappled by the mind flayer. <em>Hit:</em> 55 (10d10) piercing damage. This attack can only be used on a incapacitated humanoid grappled by the mind flayer. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Mind Blast (Recharge 5–6)</strong>: The mind flayer magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (4d8 + 4) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Nihiloor the<b> mind flayer</b> has carved out its own lair within Xanathar's lair (areas X23 through X26).

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends. Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language. Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":"At Will"},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":null,"units":null,"type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":2,"school":"div","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"A copper piece","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"always","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":30000},{"_id":"ZDJmMGZkMWUyMjRj","flags":{},"name":"Levitate","type":"spell","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/wind-grasp-magenta-2.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration.

The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.<br><br><strong><em>Lords of Tyranny.</em></strong> Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.<br><br>Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.<br><br><strong><em>Obedience and Ambition.</em></strong> In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.<br><br>At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.<br><br><strong><em>Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers.</em></strong> Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus’s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.<br><br>To own a creature’s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal’s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.<br><br><h2>The Infernal Hierarchy</h2>The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26111839/icO5Q3Fw_QzloxCpLG19pg/med.jpg?1481310510\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\">A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.<br><br>If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever—a fate that even Asmodeus fears.<br><br><strong><em>Archdevils.</em></strong> The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.<br><br><strong><em>Greater Devils.</em></strong> The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.<br><br><strong><em>Lesser Devils.</em></strong> The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Lemures.</em></strong> The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.<br><br><strong><em>Promotion and Demotion.</em></strong> When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil’s memories passing intact from one form to the next.<br><br>Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.<br><br><h3>Infernal Hierarchy</h3>1. lemure<br><br><strong>Lesser devils<br></strong>2. imp<br>3. spined devil<br>4. bearded devil<br>5. barbed devil<br>6. chain devil<br>7. bone devil<br><br><strong>Greater devils<br></strong>8. horned devil<br>9. erinyes<br>10. ice devil<br>11. pit fiend<br><br><strong>Archdevils<br></strong>12. duke or duchess<br>13. archduke or archduchess\n\n\t<br><br>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories—and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.<br><br>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other’s most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.<br><br><h3>The Nine Hells</h3>The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by archdevils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.<br><br><h2>Devil True Names and Talismans</h2>Though devils all have common names, every devil above a lemure in station also has a true name that it keeps secret. A devil can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the true names of certain devils.<br><br>\n\tA mortal who learns a devil’s true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the devil from the Nine Hells and bind it into service. Binding can also be accomplished with the help of a devil talisman. Each of these ancient relics is inscribed with the true name of a devil it controls, and was bathed in the blood of a worthy sacrifice—typically someone the creator loved—when crafted.<br><br>\n\tHowever it is summoned, a devil brought to the Material Plane typically resents being pressed into service. However, the devil seizes every opportunity to corrupt its summoner so that the summoner’s soul ends up in the Nine Hells. Only imps are truly content to be summoned, and they easily commit to serving a summoner as a familiar, but they still do their utmost to corrupt those who summon them.\n\n\n<br><br><h2>Bearded Devil (Barbazu)</h2>Bearded devils serve archdevils as shock troops, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder and reveling in the glory of battle. They respond with violence to any slight, real or imagined, gorging themselves on violence as their infernal saw-toothed glaives carve a path through their foes.<br><br>A bearded devil is humanoid in form, with pointed ears, scaly skin, a long tail, and claws that clearly show its fiendish nature. These devils take their names from the snakelike growths that adorn their chins, which they use to lash and poison enemies, weakening them with their virulent venom.\n<br><br>\n\n\n<h3>Layers and the Lords of the Nine Hells</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Layer</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Layer Name</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Archduke or Archduchess</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Previous Rulers</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Primary Inhabitants</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n1\n</td>\n<td>\nAvernus\n</td>\n<td>\nZariel\n</td>\n<td>\nBel, Tiamat\n</td>\n<td>\nErinyes, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n2\n</td>\n<td>\nDis\n</td>\n<td>\nDispater\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBearded devils, erinyes, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n3\n</td>\n<td>\nMinauros\n</td>\n<td>\nMammon\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBearded devils, chain devils, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n4\n</td>\n<td>\nPhlegethos\n</td>\n<td>\nBelial and Fierna\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n5\n</td>\n<td>\nStygia\n</td>\n<td>\nLevistus\n</td>\n<td>\nGeryon\n</td>\n<td>\nBone devils, erinyes, ice devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n6\n</td>\n<td>\nMalbolge\n</td>\n<td>\nGlasya\n</td>\n<td>\nMalagard, Moloch\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n7\n</td>\n<td>\nMaladomini\n</td>\n<td>\nBaalzebul\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n8\n</td>\n<td>\nCania\n</td>\n<td>\nMephistopheles\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nHorned devils, ice devils, imps, pit fiends\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n9\n</td>\n<td>\nNessus\n</td>\n<td>\nAsmodeus\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nAll devils</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Devil's Sight</strong>: Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.<br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><strong>Steadfast</strong>: The devil can't be frightened while it can see an allied creature within 30 feet of it.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The devil makes two attacks: one with its beard and one with its glaive.<br><br><strong>Beard</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit</em>: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><br><strong>Glaive</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or lose 5 (1d10) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 5 (1d10). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom, Medicine, check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.<br><br><strong>Variant: Summon Devil (1/Day)</strong>: The devil chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning. A bearded devil has a 30 percent chance of summoning one bearded devil. A summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can’t summon other devils. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Lord Cassalanter's doppelganger valet, in the guise of an elderly tiefling named Willifort Crowelle, sits in the passenger cab, which grants half cover.

Specters no longer possess connections to who or what they were, yet are condemned to walk the world forever. Some are spawned when dark magic or the touch of a wraith rips a soul from a living body.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Beyond Redemption.</em></strong> When a ghost’s unfinished business is completed, it can rest at last. No such rest or redemption awaits a specter. It is doomed to the Material Plane, its only end the oblivion that comes with the destruction of its soul. Until then, it bears out its lonely life in forlorn places, carrying on forgotten through the ages of the world.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Undying Hatred.</em></strong> Living creatures remind the specter that life is beyond its grasp. The mere sight of the living overwhelms a specter with sorrow and wrath, which can be abated only by destroying said life. A specter kills quickly and mercilessly, for only by depriving others of life can it gain the slightest satisfaction. However, no matter how many lives it extinguishes, a specter always succumbs to its hatred and sorrow.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Dwellers in Darkness.</em></strong> Sunlight represents a source of life that no specter can ever hope to douse, and it pains them. When night falls, they leave their final resting places in search of living creatures to slay, knowing that few weapons can harm them in return. At the first light of dawn, they retreat back into the darkness, where they remain until night falls again.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A specter doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<h3>Variant: Poltergeist</h3>\nA poltergeist is a different kind of specter — the confused, invisible spirit of an individual with no sense of how he or she died. A poltergeist expresses its rage by hurling creatures and objects using the power of its shattered psyche. The Poltergeist stat block can be found <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/compendium/monstermanual/Monsters:Poltergeist#content\">here</a>.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Incorporeal Movement</strong>: The specter can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Sunlight Sensitivity</strong>: While in sunlight, the specter has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Life Drain</strong>: <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-4ad7470a-01e3-86d3-240e-8c77e1969942\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The former tavern is haunted by the poltergeist (<b>specter</b>) of the tavern's previous barkeeper, a half-elf named Lif.

When not commanded, they follow the last order they received to the best of their ability, and can act independently to fulfill simple instructions. Some animated objects (including many of those created in the Feywild) might converse fluently or adopt a persona, but most are simple automatons.<br><br><strong><em>Constructed Nature.</em></strong> An animated object doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep. <br><br>The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.<br><br><h2>Flying Sword</h2>A flying sword dances through the air, fighting with the confidence of a warrior that can’t be injured. Swords are the most common weapons animated with magic. Axes, clubs, daggers, maces, spears, and even self-loading crossbows are also known to exist in animated object form.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Antimagic Susceptibility</strong>: The sword is incapacitated while in the area of an <em>antimagic field</em>. If targeted by dispel magic, the sword must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.<br><br><strong>False Appearance</strong>: While the sword remains motionless and isn't flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal sword.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Longsword</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage.<br><br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-c2533be0-fd9d-1ade-20bb-a8236a8a50e8\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Scattered on the floors throughout the old tower are six longswords with no traces of rust or blood on them.

The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.<br><br>\n\tOrcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god’s eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.<br><br>\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26272041/OHfz6qo0xHu-1gTc-Wo-5g/med.png?1481668533\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\">\n\n\t<strong><em>Tribes like Plagues.</em></strong> Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Ranging Scavengers.</em></strong> Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes’ villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.<br><br>\n\tWhen an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.<br><br>\n\tOn rare occasions, a tribe’s leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Leadership and Might.</em></strong> Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.<br><br>\n\tStrength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Orc Crossbreeds.</em></strong> Luthic, the orc goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs’ drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Orog</h2>\n\nOrogs are orcs blessed with a surprisingly keen intellect that ordinary orcs believe is a gift from the orc goddess Luthic. Like Luthic, orogs prefer to live underground, although the scarcity of food often brings them to the surface to hunt. Orcs respect an orog’s strength and cunning, and a lone orog might command an orc war band.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Stronger and Smarter.</em></strong> An orog uses its strength to bully other orcs and its intelligence to surprise enemies on the battlefield. Many an overconfident elf, human, or dwarf commander has watched a “simple” orc warlord execute a clever maneuver to outflank and destroy an opposing force, not realizing the orc is an orog.<br><br>\n\tWhen encountered in great numbers, orogs form their own detachments within much larger orc hordes, and they are always at the forefront of any attack, relying on their superior strength and tactical insight to overcome anything that stands in their way.<br><br>\n\tFew orc tribes actively seek out orogs to bolster their ranks. The orogs’ superiority makes them ideal leaders, and thus deadly rivals to orc war chiefs, who must be wary of orog treachery.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Detached Killers.</em></strong> Wanting nothing more than to hack their enemies to pieces, orogs are a terrifying presence on the battlefield. They form no attachments, even to their parents and siblings, and have no concept of love or dedication. They worship the orc pantheon of gods—Gruumsh and Luthic foremost—because they believe that the gods have strength beyond reason, and physical might is all they respect.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Servants of Darkness.</em></strong> Mistrusted by orcs, some orogs form independent mercenary war bands that sell themselves to the highest bidder. As long as they are rewarded, orog mercenaries gladly serve as elite warriors and shock troops for evil wizards, depraved giants, and other villains.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Aggressive</strong>: As a bonus action, the orc can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can

Feathers cover the thick, shaggy coat of its bearlike body, and the limpid pupils of its great round eyes stare furiously from its owlish head.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDeadly Ferocity.</em></strong> The owlbear’s reputation for ferocity, aggression, stubbornness, and sheer ill temper makes it one of the most feared predators of the wild. There is little, if anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even monsters that outmatch an owlbear in size and strength avoid tangling with it, for this creature cares nothing about a foe’s superior strength as it attacks without provocation.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tConsummate Predators.</em></strong> An owlbear emerges from its den around sunset and hunts into the darkest hours of the night, hooting or screeching to declare its territory, to search for a mate, or to flush prey into its hunting grounds. These are typically forests familiar to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry’s escape routes.<br><br>\n\tAn owlbear makes its den in a cave or ruin littered with the bones of its prey. It drags partially devoured kills back to its den, storing portions of the carcass among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees. The scent of blood and rotting flesh hangs heavy near an owlbear’s lair, attracting scavengers and thus luring more prey.<br><br>\n\tOwlbears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is plentiful, a family of owlbears might remain together for longer than is required to rear offspring. Otherwise, they part ways as soon as the young are ready to hunt.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSavage Companions.</em></strong> Although they are more intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligent creature can train an owlbear to recognize it as a master, making it an unflinching guard or a fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on which owlbear will attack its handler as they do on which will reach the finish line first.<br><br>\n\tElven communities encourage owlbears to den beneath their treetop villages, using the beasts as a natural defense during the night. Hobgoblins favor owlbears as war beasts, and hill giants and frost giants sometimes keep owlbears as pets. A starved owlbear might show up in a gladiatorial arena, ruthlessly eviscerating and devouring its foes before a bloodthirsty audience.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tOwlbear Origins.</em></strong> Scholars have long debated the origins of the owlbear. The most common theory is that a demented wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear. However, venerable elves claim to have known these creatures for thousands of years, and some fey insist that owlbears have always existed in the Feywild.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Keen Sight and Smell</strong>: The owlbear has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The owlbear makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its claws.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Beak</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Claws</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span style=\"color: rgb( 64 , 64 , 64 )\">Each pen in area J20 in is effectively a cell equipped with a sliding door that can be double-latched from the outside.

This check is made with advantage if food is given to the creature.

The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality. The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.

If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it. Clenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage. Forceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it. Grasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Interposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score.

Each of the Seven Sisters is a powerful and ageless beauty with a penchant for arcane magic.<br></span><br>Long ago, Laeral ruled a kingdom called Stornanter and held the title of Witch-Queen of the North. After that, she led a band of adventurers called the Nine. She met and married Khelben Arunsun, who would later become the Blackstaff, the Lord Mage of Waterdeep. After Khelben died, Laeral retired from public life. She resurfaced after the Spellplague and the Sundering, weakened by Mystra's death, rebirth, and withdrawal from the world.<br><br>Laeral's magic isn't as great as it once was, though she does her utmost to hide this fact. Only Elminster, her trusted friend and advisor, knows the extent of her decline. Despite her diminished abilities, Laeral remains a formidable, clear-headed wizard with plenty of magic at her disposal.<br><br>A few years ago, Dagult Neverember was ousted as Open Lord of Waterdeep. Laeral reluctantly stepped into the vacancy at the request of the Masked Lords, and has served as Waterdeep's Open Lord ever since. Initially overwhelmed by the demands of the nobles and guildmasters, she has settled nicely into her new role. She uses her magic sparingly and relies on trusted advisors and deputies. As time allows, she likes to venture outside the Palace of Waterdeep in disguise, just to clear her head or check up on old friends (and enemies).<br><br>Laeral's relationship with Vajra Safahr, the current Blackstaff, has its challenges. For one thing, Laeral is much older, much wiser, and much more powerful than Vajra, whom she views as an insecure child. In addition, Vajra wields the Blackstaff, which has Khelben Arunsun's soul and the souls of all the other Blackstaffs bound inside it. Laeral covets the staff, because it contains all that's left of her husband.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. On Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to. Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":"","units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":290000},{"_id":"N2ViYjk4MDU1YTI1","flags":{},"name":"Feeblemind","type":"spell","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/light-eerie-3.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality.

Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.<br><br><strong><em>Spawn of Chaos.</em></strong> The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26078751/KlZRu6G4cK-cSNmLbXXRWw/med.jpg?1481223347\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\"><strong><em>Capricious Elevation.</em></strong> Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon’s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.<br><br>A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.<br><br>By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon’s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.<br><br><strong><em>Abyssal Invasions.</em></strong> Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.<br><br>Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.<br><br><strong><em>Signs of Corruption.</em></strong> Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.<br><br><strong><em>Eternal Evil.</em></strong> Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can’t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor. It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed. The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the Abyss and kill it there.<br><br><strong><em>Protected Essence.</em></strong> A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon’s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.<br><br>Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holds—or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.<br><br><strong><em>Demonic Cults.</em></strong> Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord’s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.<br><br><strong><em>Demon Summoning.</em></strong> Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.<br><br>Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another’s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.<br><br><strong><em>Bound Demons.</em></strong> <em>The Book of Vile Darkness</em>, the <em>Black Scrolls of Ahm</em>, and the <em>Demonomicon of Iggwilv</em> are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend’s return to the Abyss.<br><br>An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.<br><br><strong><em>Demonic Possession.</em></strong> No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.<br><br>As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.<br><br>\n<h2>Demon True Names</h2>Though demons all have common names, every demon lord and every demon of type 1 through 6 has a true name that it keeps secret. A demon can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the true names of the most powerful demons.<br><br>A mortal who learns a demon’s true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the demon from the Abyss and exercise some measure of control over it. However, most demons brought to the Material Plane in this manner do everything in their power to wreak havoc or sow discord and strife.<br><br><h2>Demon Lords</h2>The chaotic power of the Abyss rewards demons of particular ruthlessness and ingenuity with a dark blessing, transforming them into unique fiends whose power can rival the gods. These demon lords rule through cunning or brute force, hoping to one day claim the prize of absolute control over all the Abyss.<br><br><strong><em>Reward for Outsiders.</em></strong> Although most demon lords rise up from the vast and uncountable mobs of demons rampaging across the Abyss, the plane also rewards outsiders that conquer any of its infinite layers. The elven goddess Lolth became a demon lord after Corellon Larethian cast her into the Abyss for betraying elvenkind. Sages claim that the Dark Prince Graz’zt originated on some other plane before stealing his abyssal title from another long-forgotten demon lord.<br><br><strong><em>Power and Control. </em></strong>The greatest sign of a demon lord’s power is its ability to reshape an abyssal realm. A layer of the Abyss controlled by a demon lord becomes a twisted reflection of that fiend’s vile personality, and demon lords seldom leave their realms for fear of allowing another creature to reshape and seize it.<br><br>As with other demons, a demon lord that dies on another plane has its essence return to the Abyss, where it reforms into a new body. Likewise, a demon lord that dies in the Abyss is permanently destroyed. Most demon lords keep a portion of their essence safely stored away to prevent such a fate.<br><br><h3>Baphomet</h3>The demon lord Baphomet, also known as the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts, rules over minotaurs and other savage creatures. If he had his way, civilization would crumble and all races would embrace their base animal savagery.<br><br>The Prince of Beasts appears as a huge, black-furred minotaur with iron horns, red eyes, and a blood-soaked mouth. His iron crown is topped with the rotting heads of his enemies, while his dark armor is set with spikes and skull-like serrations. He carries a huge glaive named Heartcleaver, but often hurls it into the fray so as to face his enemies with horns and hooves.<br><br><h3>Demogorgon</h3>The Sibilant Beast and the self-styled Prince of Demons, Demogorgon yearns for nothing less than undoing the order of the multiverse. An insane assemblage of features and drives, the Prince of Demons inspires fear and hatred among other demons and demon lords.<br><br>Demogorgon towers three times the height of a human, his body as sinuous as a snake’s and as powerful as a great ape’s. Suckered tentacles take the place of his arms. His saurian lower torso ends in webbed and clawed feet, and a forked tail whose whip-like tips are armed with cruel blades. The Prince of Demons has two baleful baboon heads, both of them mad. It is only the conflict between the two halves of his dual nature that keeps the demon lord’s ambitions in check.<br><br><h3>Graz’zt</h3>The demon lord Graz’zt appears as a darkly handsome figure nearly nine feet tall. Those who refer to the Dark Prince as the most humanoid of the demon lords vastly underestimate the capacity for evil in his scheming heart.<br><br>Graz’zt is a striking physical specimen, whose demonic nature shows in his ebon skin, pointed ears, yellow fangs, crown of horns, and six-fingered hands. He delights in finery, pageantry, and sating his decadent desires with subjects and consorts alike, among whom incubi and succubi are often his favorites.<br><br><h3>Juiblex</h3>The demon lord of slimes and oozes, Juiblex is a stew of noxious fluids that lurks in the abyssal depths. The wretched Faceless Lord cares nothing for cultists or mortal servants, and its sole desire is to turn all creatures into formless copies of its horrid self.<br><br>In its resting state, Juiblex spreads out in a noxious mass, bubbling and filling the air with a profound stench. On the rare occasions when creatures confront the demon lord, Juiblex draws itself up into a shuddering cone of slime striated with veins of black and green. Baleful red eyes swim within its gelatinous body, while dripping pseudopods of ooze lash out hungrily at any creature they can reach.<br><br><h3>Lolth</h3>The Demon Queen of Spiders is the evil matron of the drow. Her every thought is touched by malice, and the depth of her viciousness can surprise even her most faithful priestesses. She directs her faithful while she weaves plots across the worlds of the Material Plane, looking forward to the time when her drow followers bring those worlds under her control.<br><br>Lolth appears as a lithe, imperious drow matriarch when she manifests to her followers in the mortal realm, which she does with unusual frequency. When battle breaks out—or if she has a reason to remind her followers to fear her—Lolth’s lower body transforms into that of a huge demonic spider, whose spike-tipped legs and mandibles tear foes apart.<br><br><h3>Orcus</h3>Known as the Demon Prince of Undeath and the Blood Lord, the demon lord Orcus is worshiped by the undead and by living creatures that channel the power of undeath. A brooding and nihilistic entity, Orcus yearns to make the multiverse a place of death and darkness, forever unchanging except by his will.<br><br>The Demon Prince of Undeath is a foul and corpulent creature, with a humanoid torso, powerful goat legs, and the desiccated head of a ram. His sore-ridden body stinks of disease, but his decaying head and glowing red eyes are as a creature already dead. Great black bat wings sprout from his back, stirring reeking air as he moves.<br><br>Orcus wields a malevolent artifact known as the <em>Wand of Orcus</em>, a mace-like rod of obsidian topped by a humanoid skull. He surrounds himself with undead, and living creatures not under his control are anathema to him.<br><br><h3>Yeenoghu</h3>Known as the Gnoll Lord and the Beast of Butchery, the demon lord Yeenoghu hungers for slaughter and senseless destruction. Gnolls are his mortal instruments, and he drives them to ever-greater atrocities in his name. Delighting in sorrow and hopelessness, the Gnoll Lord yearns to turn the world into a wasteland in which the last surviving gnolls tear each other apart for the right to feast upon the dead.<br><br>Yeenoghu appears as a huge, scarred gnoll with a spiky crest of black spines, and eyes that burn with emerald flame. His armor is a patchwork of shields and breastplates claimed from fallen foes, and decorated by those foes’ flayed skins. Yeenoghu can summon a triple flail he calls the Butcher, which he wields to deadly effect or wills to fly independently into battle as he tears foes apart with teeth and claws.<br><br><h3>Other Demon Lords</h3>No one knows the full number of demon lords that rage in the Abyss. Given the infinite depths of that plane, powerful demons constantly rise to become demon lords, then fall almost as quickly. Among the demon lords whose power has endured long enough for demonologists to name them are Fraz-Urb’luu, the Prince of Deception; Kostchtchie, the Prince of Wrath; Pazuzu, Prince of the Lower Aerial Kingdoms; and Zuggtmoy, Lady of Fungi.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Barlgura</h2>The barlgura represents the savagery and brutality of the Abyss. Barlguras gather in packs to take down tougher foes, keep gruesome trophies from their victories, and decorate their territory with such objects.<br><br>A barlgura looks like a hulking orangutan with a gruesome, drooping visage and tusks jutting from its jaw. Standing just under 8 feet tall, it has broad shoulders and weighs 650 pounds. It moves apishly along the ground, but it climbs with great speed and agility.\n\n\n<br><br><h2>Demon Types</h2>Demonologists organize the chaotic distribution of demons into broad categories of power known as types. Most demons fit into one of six major types, with the weakest categorized as Type 1 and the strongest as Type 6. Demons outside the six main types are categorized as minor demons and demon lords.<br><br><h3>Demons by Type</h3><table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Type</td>\n<td>Examples</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>barlgura, shadow demon, vrock</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>chasme, hezrou</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>glabrezu, yochlol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>nalfeshnee</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>marilith</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>balor, goristro</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>\n\nInnate Spellcasting</strong>: The barlgura’s spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13). The barlgura can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:<br><br>• 1/day each: <em>entangle</em>, <em>phantasmal force</em><br>• 2/day each: <em>disguise self</em>, <em>invisibility</em> (self only)<br><br><strong>Reckless</strong>: At the start of its turn, the barlgura can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.<br><br><strong>Running Leap</strong>: The barlgura’s long jump is up to 40 feet and its high jump is up to 20 feet when it has a running start.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The barlgura makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its fists.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Fist</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 9 (1d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day)</strong>: The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning. A barlgura has a 30 percent chance of summoning one barlgura. A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-2194193e-fcfc-c312-f67a-535833b82e7e\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">If the characters free the <b>barlgura </b>demon in area K15 and allow it to roam Kolat Towers, Manshoon loses many followers to the demon's rampage.<br></span></span><br>Three apprentice wizards stand outside the circle in area K16, chanting an incantation.

If any of them stop chanting, the demon awakes and becomes enraged, though it remains bound within the circle. Whenever it takes damage, the barlgura can attempt a DC 10 Charisma check. On a successful check, it breaks out of the circle and attacks any creature it can reach.<br><br>Freeing the barlgura disrupts Manshoon's operation, forcing the wizard to spend time and resources defeating the fiend and replacing slain underlings.</p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Chaotic Evil","race":"","type":"fiend (demon)","environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["cold","fire","lightning"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"senses":"blindsight 30 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 15","languages":{"value":["abyssal"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NmU5YzIxZWRkN2Yx","sort":350000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/035_-_Barlgura/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Barlgura","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/035_-_Barlgura/token.png","tint":null,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":130,"brightSight":120,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"NWNkZDUxYjI3MzMz","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":68,"max":68},"bar2":{"value":15,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"ZGY5MzA3MzA0NmYw","flags":{},"name":"Innate Spellcasting.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/035_-_Barlgura/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The barlgura’s spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13).

The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature. The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off. An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.

The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.<br><br><strong><em>Lords of Tyranny.</em></strong> Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.<br><br>Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.<br><br><strong><em>Obedience and Ambition.</em></strong> In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.<br><br>At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.<br><br><strong><em>Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers.</em></strong> Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus’s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.<br><br>To own a creature’s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal’s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.<br><br><h2>The Infernal Hierarchy</h2>The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26111839/icO5Q3Fw_QzloxCpLG19pg/med.jpg?1481310510\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\">A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.<br><br>If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever—a fate that even Asmodeus fears.<br><br><strong><em>Archdevils.</em></strong> The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.<br><br><strong><em>Greater Devils.</em></strong> The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.<br><br><strong><em>Lesser Devils.</em></strong> The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Lemures.</em></strong> The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.<br><br><strong><em>Promotion and Demotion.</em></strong> When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil’s memories passing intact from one form to the next.<br><br>Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.<br><br><h3>Infernal Hierarchy</h3>1. lemure<br><br><strong>Lesser devils<br></strong>2. imp<br>3. spined devil<br>4. bearded devil<br>5. barbed devil<br>6. chain devil<br>7. bone devil<br><br><strong>Greater devils<br></strong>8. horned devil<br>9. erinyes<br>10. ice devil<br>11. pit fiend<br><br><strong>Archdevils<br></strong>12. duke or duchess<br>13. archduke or archduchess\n\n\n\t<br><br>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories—and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.<br><br>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other’s most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.<br><br><h3>The Nine Hells</h3>The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by archdevils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.<br><br><h2>Devil True Names and Talismans</h2>Though devils all have common names, every devil above a lemure in station also has a true name that it keeps secret. A devil can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the true names of certain devils.<br><br>\n\tA mortal who learns a devil’s true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the devil from the Nine Hells and bind it into service. Binding can also be accomplished with the help of a devil talisman. Each of these ancient relics is inscribed with the true name of a devil it controls, and was bathed in the blood of a worthy sacrifice—typically someone the creator loved—when crafted.<br><br>\n\tHowever it is summoned, a devil brought to the Material Plane typically resents being pressed into service. However, the devil seizes every opportunity to corrupt its summoner so that the summoner’s soul ends up in the Nine Hells. Only imps are truly content to be summoned, and they easily commit to serving a summoner as a familiar, but they still do their utmost to corrupt those who summon them.\n\n\n<br><br><h2>Spined Devil (Spinagon)</h2>Smaller than most other devils, spinagons act as messengers and spies for greater devils and archdevils. They are the eyes and ears of the Nine Hells, and even fiends that despise a spined devil’s weakness treat it with a modicum of respect.<br><br>\n\tA spined devil’s body and tail bristle with spines, and it can fling its tail spines as ranged weapons. The spines burst into flame on impact.<br><br>\n\tWhen not delivering messages or gathering intelligence, spined devils serve in the infernal legions as flying artillery, making up for their relative weakness by mobbing together to overwhelm their foes. Though they crave promotion and power, spined devils are craven by nature, and they will quickly scatter if a fight goes against them.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h3>Layers and the Lords of the Nine Hells</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Layer</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Layer Name</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Archduke or Archduchess</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Previous Rulers</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Primary Inhabitants</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n1\n</td>\n<td>\nAvernus\n</td>\n<td>\nZariel\n</td>\n<td>\nBel, Tiamat\n</td>\n<td>\nErinyes, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n2\n</td>\n<td>\nDis\n</td>\n<td>\nDispater\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBearded devils, erinyes, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n3\n</td>\n<td>\nMinauros\n</td>\n<td>\nMammon\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBearded devils, chain devils, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n4\n</td>\n<td>\nPhlegethos\n</td>\n<td>\nBelial and Fierna\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n5\n</td>\n<td>\nStygia\n</td>\n<td>\nLevistus\n</td>\n<td>\nGeryon\n</td>\n<td>\nBone devils, erinyes, ice devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n6\n</td>\n<td>\nMalbolge\n</td>\n<td>\nGlasya\n</td>\n<td>\nMalagard, Moloch\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n7\n</td>\n<td>\nMaladomini\n</td>\n<td>\nBaalzebul\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n8\n</td>\n<td>\nCania\n</td>\n<td>\nMephistopheles\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nHorned devils, ice devils, imps, pit fiends\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n9\n</td>\n<td>\nNessus\n</td>\n<td>\nAsmodeus\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nAll devils&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Devil’s Sight</strong>:&nbsp;Magical darkness doesn’t impede the devil’s darkvision.<br><br><strong>Flyby</strong>: The devil doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.<br><br><strong>Limited Spines</strong>: The devil has twelve tail spines.

They aggressively attack any creature that trespasses on their territory or disturbs their feasting.<br><br><strong><em>Carrion Eaters. </em></strong>A carrion crawler follows the scent of death to its food, but it prefers not to compete with other scavengers. These foul creatures thus hunker down in territories where death is plentiful and other carrion eaters have limited mobility. Caves, sewers, dungeons, and forested marshes are their favored lairs, but carrion crawlers are also drawn to battlefields and cemeteries.<br><br>A carrion crawler roams on the hunt, its tentacles probing the air for the scent of blood or decay. In tunnels or ruins, carrion crawlers scurry across the ceiling as they move toward food. In this way, they avoid contact with oozes, otyughs, and other dangerous inhabitants of the darkness, even as they surprise potential meals that don’t think to look up.<br><br><strong><em>Patient Predators.</em></strong> Whether in subterranean darkness or while hunting at night, light signals a potential meal. A carrion crawler might follow a light source from a distance for hours, hoping to pick up the scent of blood. Despite their great size, carrion crawlers can also easily set up ambushes by waiting around blind corners for prey to come to them.<br><br>When facing potential prey or intruders, a carrion crawler lets its poison do the work. Once a victim goes rigid with paralysis, the carrion crawler wraps it with its tentacles and drags it away to a high ledge or isolated passageway, where it can be killed safely.

It wears a sharp-toothed grin and expresses its delight by the twitching of its tail, its merriment fading only if it is attacked.<br><br><strong><em>Invisible Tricksters.</em></strong> The only warning of a faerie dragon’s presence is a stifled giggle. The dragon stays out of sight, watching invisibly as its victims contend with its pranks. When its fun is done, the dragon might reveal itself, depending on the disposition of its “prey.”<br><br><strong><em>Friendly and Bright.</em></strong> A faerie dragon has a sharp mind, a fondness for treasure and good company, and a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie dragon’s draconic nature by offering it “treasure” in the form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange for information or safe passage through its territory.<br><br><strong><em>The Colors of Age.</em></strong> A faerie dragon’s scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting ability, gaining new spells as they mature.<br><br><table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dragon Color</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Age Range</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Red</td>\n<td>5 years or less</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Orange</td>\n<td>6-10 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Yellow</td>\n<td>11-20 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td>21-30 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>31-40 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Indigo</td>\n<td>41-50 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Violet</td>\n<td>51 years or more</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table><h2>A Note About Challenge Rating</h2>The challenge rating for a faerie dragon is dependent on its color. 1 (200 XP) for a red, orange, or yellow faerie dragon; 2 (450 XP) for a green, blue, indigo, or violet faerie dragon. For the purposes of Compendium sorting, we've assigned this monster entry a CR of 1 (200 XP).<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Superior Invisibility</strong>: As a bonus action, the dragon can magically turn invisible until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the dragon wears or carries is invisible with it.<br><br><strong>Limited Telepathy</strong>: Using telepathy, the dragon can magically communicate with any other faerie dragon within 60 feet of it.<br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The dragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The dragon’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast a number of spells, requiring no material components. As the dragon ages and changes color, it gains additional spells as shown below.<br><br>• Red, 1/day each: <em>dancing lights</em>, <em>mage hand</em>, <em>minor illusion</em><br>• Orange, 1/day: <em>color spray</em><br>• Yellow, 1/day: <em>mirror image</em><br>• Green, 1/day: <em>suggestion</em><br>• Blue, 1/day: <em>major image</em><br>• Indigo, 1/day: <em>hallucinatory terrain</em><br>• Violet, 1/day: <em>polymorph</em><br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit</em>: 1 (1d1) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Euphoria Breath (Recharge 5–6)</strong>: The dragon exhales a puff of euphoria gas at one creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can’t take reactions and must roll a d6 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior during the turn:<br>1–4. The target takes no action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.<br>5–6. The target doesn’t move, and the only thing it can do on its turn is make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Iokaste's late husband, Algondar Daliano, had a violet <b>faerie dragon</b> companion named Wishes. The faerie dragon detests Iokaste but remains on the payroll, begrudgingly using its magic to enhance performances for the sake of preserving Algondar's legacy. It prefers to remain invisible and unseen otherwise. Iokaste refers to it derisively as “the flying serpent.”<br></span><br>If the characters threaten it or endanger the theater, Wishes uses its magic to confound and neutralize them. As they make their way to the Vault of Dragons, it follows them invisibly. Once it learns about the gold in the vault, the faerie dragon casts mirror image on itself, turns visible, and addresses the characters telepathically. It demands a share of the hoard (at least 5,000 gp), threatens to tip off the City Watch if the characters refuse, and makes good on its threat if the characters don't share the wealth. The faerie dragon doesn't have a hoard of its own, since it gives its earnings to unfortunate Waterdavians by invisibly flying around the city at night and leaving coins on doorsteps, window sills, nightstands, and pillows.</p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Chaotic Good","race":"","type":"dragon","environment":"","cr":1,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":200},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13","languages":{"value":["draconic","sylvan"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"passive":6},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":7,"passive":17},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NmU5YzIxZWRkN2Yx","sort":470000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/047_-_Faerie_Dragon/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Faerie Dragon","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/047_-_Faerie_Dragon/token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"NjYyOWM4NjI1NzM0","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":14,"max":14},"bar2":{"value":15,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"ZjM3NGE4Zjc0NjVm","flags":{},"name":"Superior Invisibility.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/047_-_Faerie_Dragon/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a bonus action, the dragon can magically turn invisible until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).

If it succeeds, the spell ends.

The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves—the drow—found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26322810/Yh-mZ91x5frzYXZJ_Fp80Q/med.jpg?1481818797\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\"><strong><em>Children of Lolth.</em></strong> The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do.<br><br>\n\tThe wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCreatures of Darkness.</em></strong> The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUnderdark Cities.</em></strong> The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings.<br><br>\n\tA drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDrow Magic.</em></strong> Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tArms and Armor.</em></strong> Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCutthroat Politics.</em></strong> Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.<br><br>\n\tDrow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house’s social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMatriarchal Rule.</em></strong> Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.<br><br>\n\tIn drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow—either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can’t be priests, nor can they rule a house.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tPoison Predilection.</em></strong> Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Drow Mage</h2>\nPrivileged drow males who lack the strength and fighting prowess to train as warriors have no recourse but to pursue the study of magic. For them, it is a matter of survival. Female drow with a natural affinity for the arcane arts may also become drow mages, although they are much less common.<br><br>\n\n\n<br><br>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26322823/8Gl25c25yxM2iYr6A-q4iw/med.jpg?1481818847\"></div><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Fey Ancestry</strong>: The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.<br><br><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The drow's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12).

On each of the drow's turns for the duration, the drow can use its action to deal 1d12 damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if the drow uses its action to do anything else, if the target is outside the spell's range, or if the target has total cover from the drow.<br><br><strong>Summon Demon (1/Day)</strong>: The drow magically summons a quasit, or attempts to summon a shadow demon with a 50 percent chance of success. The summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can’t summon other demons. It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.</p>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Xanathar's advisor is a nervous and conniving male drow named Nar'l Xibrindas.

The beholder's paranoia will eventually cause Xanathar to question the drow's loyalty, though, and Nar'l has become increasingly worried about his future. If forced to decide between himself and Bregan D'aerthe, he'll choose the former and betray his drow allies to save his own skin.<br></span><br>Xanathar is aware that something is off with Nar'l, and recently assigned him a grell bodyguard. The grell has instructions to dispose of Nar'l at the first sign of disloyalty.<br><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><h4><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Game Statistics</span></h4>Nar'l Xibrindas is a drow mage.

Change Appearance. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again. Natural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"hour"},"target":{"value":null,"units":null,"type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":2,"school":"trs","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":180000},{"_id":"OWJmYWViOWZkMjY4","flags":{},"name":"Misty Step","type":"spell","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/wind-grasp-air-1.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"bonus","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":null,"units":null,"type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":2,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":190000},{"_id":"ODM4ZGUwMjRiMDNk","flags":{},"name":"Web","type":"spell","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/shielding-spirit-3.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range.

Long ago humans and their ilk drove the kuo-toa underground, where they dwell in madness and everlasting night. Kuo-toa can no longer abide daylight.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26532514/R-xjzdAO6IobHivgfjaw2w/med.jpg?1482326474\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\"><strong><em>Mad Slaves.</em></strong> At the height of the illithid empire, the mind flayers captured kuo-toa by the thousands and forced them into bondage. The kuo-toa were simple creatures, never meant to endure the oppressive mental force the illithids unleashed against them. By the time the mind flayers abandoned them, the prolonged psychic subjugation endured by the kuo-toa had driven them mad.<br><br>Their minds shattered beyond repair, the kuo-toa adopted a religious fervor, inventing gods to protect them against threats. Most notable of these threats are the drow, which have slain the kuo-toa on sight since the days when the two races first met.<br><br><strong><em>God Makers.</em></strong> Kuo-toa worship gods of their own insane creation, but if enough kuo-toa believe that a god is real, the energy of their collective subconscious can cause that god to manifest as a physical entity. The form a kuo-toa god takes depends on the inspiration for its divine image, and is usually random or nonsensical.<br><br>One of the most revered gods of the kuo-toa is Blibdoolpoolp the Sea Mother, who takes the form of a female human with a crayfish head, a crayfish’s claws, and an articulated shell covering her shoulders. Blibdoolpoolp was likely invented by a kuo-toa that improved on a broken human statue by adding the limbs and head of a crustacean. In sudden awe of its handiwork, it then named the resulting form a god.<br><br>Kuo-toa that cross paths with an aboleth often find themselves worshiping it as a god, their madness blinding them to the fact that the aboleth is merely using them for its own nefarious ends.<br><br><strong><em>Theocratic Rulers.</em></strong> Kuo-toa archpriests are surrounded by fanatical devotees of their faith. The archpriest of a kuo-toa domain demands that all its subjects worship a specific god. An archpriest’s mad belief in its god is so fervent that it manifests the powers of a high cleric. The archpriest can also bestow spells to devout underlings called whips. One or more of these whips are also the archpriest’s children, and their primary role in kuo-toan society is to fight to the death to claim the throne when the archpriest dies. If a whip displeases the archpriest, the archpriest can strip it of its spellcasting ability, if not its life.<br><br>The archpriest’s decrees are enforced by monitors, devout kuo-toa that act as the archpriest’s eyes and ears. Monitors are deadly hand-to-hand combatants, and lesser kuo-toa live in fear of them.<br><br><strong><em>Kuo-toa Gear.</em></strong> Many weapons of the kuo-toa are designed to capture rather than kill. Nets are common, though some carry pincer staffs (also called mancatchers) designed to trap and immobilize foes. Kuo-toa warriors also treat their shields with a sticky goo that catches incoming weapons.<br><br>In general, kuo-toa don’t like the weight of armor on their slippery bodies and rely on their natural rubbery hides for protection. However, they like to wear jewelry made from scavenged bones, shells, pearls, gems, and carapace fragments.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Amphibious</strong>: The kuo-toa can breathe air and water.<br><br><strong>Otherworldly Perception</strong>: The kuo-toa can sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of it that is invisible or on the Ethereal Plane. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving.<br><br><strong>Slippery</strong>: The kuo-toa has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.<br><br><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity</strong>: While in sunlight, the kuo-toa has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br><strong>Spellcasting</strong>: The kuo-toa is a 2nd-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). The kuo-toa has the following cleric spells prepared:<br><br>• Cantrips (at will): <em>sacred flame</em>, <em>thaumaturgy</em><br>• 1st level (3 slots): <em>bane</em>, <em>shield of faith</em><br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The kuo-toa makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its pincer staff.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Pincer Staff</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.<em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled, escape DC 14. Until this grapple ends, the kuo-toa can’t use its pincer staff on another target.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">A <b>kuo-toa whip </b>and six&nbsp;kuo-toa&nbsp;guard the hall.

They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAnimated Dead.</em></strong> Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling dismantled limbs. This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.<br><br>\n\tWhile most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tObedient Servants.</em></strong> Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can’t read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.<br><br>\n\tA skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.<br><br>\n\tAlthough they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren’t mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn’t work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHabitual Behaviors.</em></strong> Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master’s control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can’t eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.<br><br>\n\tWhen skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUndead Nature.</em></strong> A skeleton doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Charge</strong>: If the skeleton moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Greataxe</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (2d12 + 4) slashing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Gore</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-e09386a8-01cf-47a8-810b-d656d4b3c7c4\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">When someone other than Ah­maergo opens the southern door to area X11, the skeleton of the stuffed minotaur erupts out of its skin, becoming an animated <b>minotaur skeleton</b>, and arms itself with the greataxe.

Using ancient dwarven knowledge and myriad slaves, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean kingdoms.<br><br>\n\tMost duergar (including females) are bald and have ashen gray skin. They wear drab clothing designed to blend in with stone, along with simple jewelry that reflects their severe and utilitarian demeanor.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSlaves to Slavers.</em></strong> The duergar were once dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind flayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.<br><br>\n\tDuergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take and hold slaves to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and crude currency.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTough as Stone.</em></strong> Like dwarves, duergar have strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A duergar’s mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other spells.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tBorn of Darkness.</em></strong> The Underdark is saturated with strange magical power, which the duergar absorbed over generations of imprisonment. A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it faces a foe it can’t fight, or when spying on creatures approaching its territory, it can just as easily become invisible to slip away into the darkness.<br><br>\n\tEons spent in the Underdark also sharpened their darkvision, allowing them to see twice as far as other dwarves. This keen eyesight comes at a cost, however, as a duergar’s vision is compromised by sunlight.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tInfernal Master.</em></strong> Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate the evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves. He offers them divine guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them on toward greater acts of tyranny, all the while concealing his true identity.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Duergar Resilience</strong>: The duergar has advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist being charmed or paralyzed.<br><br><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity</strong>: While in sunlight, the duergar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)</strong>: For 1 minute, the duergar magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the duergar is Large, doubles its damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the duergar lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.<br><br><strong>War Pick (Normal-Sized)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>War Pick (Enlarged)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Normal-Sized; Melee)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Normal-Sized; Ranged)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Enlarged; Melee)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Enlarged; Ranged)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)</strong>: The duergar magically turns invisible until it attacks, casts a spell, or uses its Enlarge, or until its concentration is broken, up to 1 hour (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is invisible with it.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">This room contains six tattered, straw-stuffed mattresses and a hostile member of the Xanathar Guild, a <b>duergar </b>named Zemk. If Krentz (CE human bandit) escaped from the Yawning Portal after the tavern brawl that kicked off the adventure, he's here as well.<br></span><br>When the characters arrive, Zemk is using pieces of furniture to barricade the door to area Q6. If Krentz is here, he's trying to explain that Zemk's approach won't work, and is telling him to plug the gap at the bottom of the door with blankets. Neither of them notices intruders right away unless the interlopers make a lot of noise.<br><br>Once combat starts, Zemk fights to the death. How Krentz reacts to the adventurers depends on how they treated him earlier. If they helped him, he gives them a chance to leave in peace, but he fights alongside Zemk if they refuse to withdraw.

The duergar were members of the Xanathar Guild that had been sent by Nar'l Xibrindas to retrieve the stone. After searching Fenerus's home and finding nothing, they were waiting for Fenerus to return when the drow showed up. The drow barely got away with their lives.</span></span></span></p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">As the characters leave the mausoleum, they are jumped by four <b>duergar</b>, members of the Xanathar Guild, who slipped past the cemetery guards using their invisibility. The leader, Gorath, accosts the characters in Dwarvish, demands the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>, and refuses to believe that they don't have it. If the stone isn't turned over to them promptly, the duergar enlarge themselves and attack. Xanathar watches the battle unfold through the eyes of a gazer, which stays out of the fight and tries to remain unseen.<br></span><br>If this encounter occurs at night, there's a 50 percent chance that Ambrose Everdawn hears the disturbance and investigates, arriving after two duergar fall in battle. The characters can convince him that they're not grave robbers with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If they're polite, Ambrose escorts them out of the City of the Dead and warns them not to trespass again. Otherwise, he attempts to subdue them and turn them over to the City Guard.</p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Korgstrod Uxgulm, the <b>duergar</b> leader, has what he believes to be the <i>Stone of Golorr</i>. He found it during a search of Fenerus's house in the Trades Ward. This stone is a clever imitation. It's gray and ovoid with streaks of black, but has no magical powers. Korgstrod has been unable to attune to it and assumes he's unworthy of it, not that the stone is fake.<br></span><br>Korgstrod plans to deliver the stone to Xanathar in due time and won't willingly part with it before then. He uses a whip to flog his kobold lackeys and keep them in line. The cowardly kobolds flee into the sewers if Korgstrod is attacked and cower in his presence otherwise.</p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Evil","race":"","type":"humanoid

They lair deep in remote forests.<br><br>\n\tFine strands of silk stream from glands in an ettercap’s abdomen, letting it shoot sticky strands of webbing to bind, entrap, or strangle its victims. It can also use its webbing to fashion elaborate snares and nets, which often festoon its lair.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tQuiet Killers.</em></strong> When travelers and explorers venture into an ettercap’s territory, the ettercap stalks them. Some meet their end wandering blindly into traps or sections of forest enclosed by webs. Others, the ettercap garrotes with strands of web or envenoms with its poisonous bite.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSylvan Despoilers.</em></strong> Though they dwell in the wilds, ettercaps have no desire to live in harmony with nature. A forest infested with ettercaps transforms into a gloomy place, choked with webs and infested with giant spiders, giant insects, and other sinister predators. Creatures that wander too far into such a wood are soon lost in a maze of webs that dangle with the bones and lost treasures of the ettercaps’ victims.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tEnemies of the Fey.</em></strong> Ettercaps are natural enemies of fey creatures. The foul creatures set web snares to catch sprites and pixies, which they hungrily devour, and will encase a dryad’s tree in webbing in a vain attempt to trap the dryad. Otherwise timid fey will sometimes approach outsiders for help in dealing with an ettercap infestation, being ill-equipped to deal with the malevolent creatures themselves.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Variant: Web Garrote</h2>\nSome ettercaps like to strangle prey using garrotes fashioned from webbing.

They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.<br><br>\n\tMany creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.<br><br>\n\tThough their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.<br><br>\n\tTrue dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.<br><br><h3>Dragon Age Categories</h3>\n\n<table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Category</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Age Range</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wyrmling</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>5 years or less</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Young</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>6-100 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adult</td>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>101-800 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ancient</td>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>801 years or more</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<h2>Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters</h2>\nDragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant.<br><br>\nA young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell’s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon’s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon’s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma bonus. The dragon’s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Metallic Dragons</h2>\nMetallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tNoble Curiosity.</em></strong> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren’t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon’s treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon’s hoard.<br><br>\n\tA metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature’s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon’s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSolitary Shapeshifters.</em></strong> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.<br><br>\n\tSome metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tThe Persistence of Memory.</em></strong> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon’s hoard three centuries before.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tKing of Good Dragons.</em></strong> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries—actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.<br><br>\n\tBahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Gold Dragon</h2>\nThe most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.<br><br>\n\tA gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon’s sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDevourer of Wealth.</em></strong> Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn’t need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren’t bribes.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tReserved Shapeshifters.</em></strong> Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons except their own mates and offspring.<br><br>\n\tOlder gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving as a companion for days or weeks on end.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMaster Hoarders.</em></strong> A gold dragon keeps its hoard in a well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without the dragon knowing about it.<br><br>\n<h2>A Gold Dragon’s Lair</h2>\nGold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.<br><br>\n<h3>Lair Actions</h3>\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:<br><br><ul>\n<li>The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>\n<li>One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the dragon’s. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h3>Regional Effects</h3>\nThe region containing a legendary gold dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:<br><br><ul>\n<li>Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.</li>\n<li>Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair. The mist doesn’t obscure anything. It assumes haunting forms when evil creatures are near the dragon or other non-evil creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.</li>\n<li>Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair sparkle and gleam, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nIf the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Amphibious</strong>: The dragon can breathe air and water.<br><br><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</strong>: If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Tail</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Frightful Presence</strong>: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.<br><br><strong>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons (fire breath or weakening breath):<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">\n<strong>Fire Breath</strong>: The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><strong>Weakening Breath</strong>: The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</div><br>\n\n<strong>Change Shape</strong>: The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Legendary Actions</h2>The dragon can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.<br><br><strong>Detect</strong>: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br><strong>Tail Attack</strong>: The dragon makes a tail attack.<br><br><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)</strong>: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><b>Aurinax </b>is a male adult gold dragon who can freely ignore <i>Ahghairon's dragonward</i> and reside in the city.

The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.<br><br><strong><em>Lords of Tyranny.</em></strong> Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.<br><br>Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.<br><br><strong><em>Obedience and Ambition.</em></strong> In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.<br><br>At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.<br><br><strong><em>Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers.</em></strong> Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus’s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.<br><br>To own a creature’s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal’s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.<br><br><h2>The Infernal Hierarchy</h2>The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26111839/icO5Q3Fw_QzloxCpLG19pg/med.jpg?1481310510\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\">A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.<br><br>If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever—a fate that even Asmodeus fears.<br><br><strong><em>Archdevils.</em></strong> The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.<br><br><strong><em>Greater Devils.</em></strong> The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.<br><br><strong><em>Lesser Devils.</em></strong> The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Lemures.</em></strong> The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.<br><br><strong><em>Promotion and Demotion.</em></strong> When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil’s memories passing intact from one form to the next.<br><br>Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.<br><br><h3>Infernal Hierarchy</h3>1. lemure<br><br><strong>Lesser devils<br></strong>2. imp<br>3. spined devil<br>4. bearded devil<br>5. barbed devil<br>6. chain devil<br>7. bone devil<br><br><strong>Greater devils<br></strong>8. horned devil<br>9. erinyes<br>10. ice devil<br>11. pit fiend<br><br><strong>Archdevils<br></strong>12. duke or duchess<br>13. archduke or archduchess\n\n\n\t<br><br>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories—and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.<br><br>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other’s most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.<br><br><h3>The Nine Hells</h3>The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by archdevils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.<br><br><h2>Devil True Names and Talismans</h2>Though devils all have common names, every devil above a lemure in station also has a true name that it keeps secret. A devil can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the true names of certain devils.<br><br>\n\tA mortal who learns a devil’s true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the devil from the Nine Hells and bind it into service. Binding can also be accomplished with the help of a devil talisman. Each of these ancient relics is inscribed with the true name of a devil it controls, and was bathed in the blood of a worthy sacrifice—typically someone the creator loved—when crafted.<br><br>\n\tHowever it is summoned, a devil brought to the Material Plane typically resents being pressed into service. However, the devil seizes every opportunity to corrupt its summoner so that the summoner’s soul ends up in the Nine Hells. Only imps are truly content to be summoned, and they easily commit to serving a summoner as a familiar, but they still do their utmost to corrupt those who summon them.\n\n\n<br><br><h2>Chain Devil (Kyton)</h2>This ominous fiend wears chains like a shroud. Driving lesser creatures before it with its fearsome gaze, a chain devil animates the chains that cover its body as well as inanimate chains nearby, which sprout hooks, blades, and spikes to eviscerate enemies.<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26114741/zBo7YIajV7J32_kJvV9CjQ/med.jpg?1481315953\"></div><br>Chain devils act as sadistic jailers and torturers in the infernal realms, relishing pain and living to inflict it on others. They are called on to torment mortal souls trapped in the Nine Hells, inflicting their sadistic fury on the horrid lemures in which those souls manifest.\n<br><br>\n\n\n<h3>Layers and the Lords of the Nine Hells</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Layer</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Layer Name</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Archduke or Archduchess</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Previous Rulers</strong>\n</td>\n<td>\n<strong>Primary Inhabitants</strong>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n1\n</td>\n<td>\nAvernus\n</td>\n<td>\nZariel\n</td>\n<td>\nBel, Tiamat\n</td>\n<td>\nErinyes, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n2\n</td>\n<td>\nDis\n</td>\n<td>\nDispater\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBearded devils, erinyes, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n3\n</td>\n<td>\nMinauros\n</td>\n<td>\nMammon\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBearded devils, chain devils, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n4\n</td>\n<td>\nPhlegethos\n</td>\n<td>\nBelial and Fierna\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, imps, spined devils\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n5\n</td>\n<td>\nStygia\n</td>\n<td>\nLevistus\n</td>\n<td>\nGeryon\n</td>\n<td>\nBone devils, erinyes, ice devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n6\n</td>\n<td>\nMalbolge\n</td>\n<td>\nGlasya\n</td>\n<td>\nMalagard, Moloch\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n7\n</td>\n<td>\nMaladomini\n</td>\n<td>\nBaalzebul\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nBarbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n8\n</td>\n<td>\nCania\n</td>\n<td>\nMephistopheles\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nHorned devils, ice devils, imps, pit fiends\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n9\n</td>\n<td>\nNessus\n</td>\n<td>\nAsmodeus\n</td>\n<td>\n—\n</td>\n<td>\nAll devils</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Devil's Sight</strong>: Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.<br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The devil makes two attacks with its chains.<br><br><strong>Chain</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.<br><br>\n\tMany creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.<br><br>\n\tThough their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.<br><br>\n\tTrue dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.<br><br><h3>Dragon Age Categories</h3>\n\n<table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Category</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Age Range</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wyrmling</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>5 years or less</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Young</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>6-100 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adult</td>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>101-800 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ancient</td>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>801 years or more</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<h2>Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters</h2>\nDragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant.<br><br>\nA young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell’s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon’s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon’s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma bonus. The dragon’s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Metallic Dragons</h2>\nMetallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tNoble Curiosity.</em></strong> Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren’t driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon’s treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon’s hoard.<br><br>\n\tA metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature’s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon’s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSolitary Shapeshifters.</em></strong> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.<br><br>\n\tSome metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tThe Persistence of Memory.</em></strong> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon’s hoard three centuries before.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tKing of Good Dragons.</em></strong> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries—actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.<br><br>\n\tBahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Bronze Dragon</h2>\nBronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily on aquatic plants and fish. They take the forms of friendly animals to observe other creatures of interest. They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.<br><br>\n\tA ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon’s head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling’s scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon’s eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDragons of the Coast.</em></strong> Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship’s captain for the item.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWar Machines.</em></strong> Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.<br><br>\n\tWhen a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWell-Organized Wealth.</em></strong> Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies’ means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon might also lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.<br><br>\n<h2>A Bronze Dragon’s Lair</h2>\nA bronze dragon lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs.<br><br>\n<h3>Lair Actions</h3>\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:<br><br><ul>\n<li>The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the <em>fog cloud</em> spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>\n<li>A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h3>Regional Effects</h3>\nThe region containing a legendary bronze dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic.<br><br><ul>\n<li>Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn’t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the <em>control weather</em> spell.</li>\n<li>Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.</li>\n<li>Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nIf the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Amphibious</strong>: The dragon can breathe air and water.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons (lightning breath or repulsion breath):<br><br><div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">\n<strong>Lightning Breath</strong>: The dragon exhales lightning in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><strong>Repulsion Breath</strong>: The dragon exhales repulsion energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 40 feet away from the dragon.</div>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-b1da8254-021d-7698-44ff-2996875359ff\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Vajra gives each character a <i>potion of water breathing </i>to complete the 3rd level mission for Force Gray (Gray Hands).<br></span></span><br>They find a <b>young bronze dragon</b>, Zelifarn, swimming around a barnacle-covered shipwreck at the bottom of the deep harbor.

They have no society to speak of, but they do serve as mercenaries to orcs, ogres, ettins, hags, and giants. As payment, trolls demand food and treasure. Trolls are difficult to control, however, doing as they please even when working with more powerful creatures.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tRegeneration.</em></strong> Smashing a troll’s bones and slashing through its rubbery hide only makes it angry. A troll’s wounds close quickly. If the monster loses an arm, a leg, or even its head, those dismembered parts can sometimes act with a life of their own. A troll can even reattach severed body parts, untroubled by its momentary disability. Only acid and fire can arrest the regenerative properties of a troll’s flesh. The trolls, enraged, will attack individuals making acid and fire attacks against them above all other prey.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTroll Freaks.</em></strong> Their regenerative capabilities make trolls especially susceptible to mutation. Although uncommon, such transformations can result from what the troll has done or what has been done to it. A decapitated troll might grow two heads from the stump of its neck, while a troll that eats a fey creature might gain one or more of that creature’s traits.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Keen Smell</strong>: The troll has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Regeneration</strong>: The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the troll's next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.<br><br>\n\n<strong>(Variant) Loathsome Limbs</strong>: Whenever the troll takes at least 15 slashing damage at one time, roll a d20 to determine what else happens to it:<br><br>\n1-10: Nothing else happens.<br>\n11-14: One leg is severed from the troll if it has any legs left.<br>\n15- 18: One arm is severed from the troll if it has any arms left.<br>\n19-20: The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it can't regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head.<br><br>\nIf the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on the troll's initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll's Regeneration trait.<br><br>\nA severed leg is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.<br><br>\nA severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.<br><br>\nIf its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it. The severed head has a speed of 0 feet and the troll's Keen Smell trait. It can make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.<br><br>\nThe troll's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The troll makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The <b>troll</b>, which currently has 44 hit points, has crawled up from the first level of Undermountain to feed on tasty humanoid flesh, bringing nine stirges with it.

This foul aberration feeds on the intelligence of sentient creatures, taking over a victim’s body on behalf of its mind flayer masters.<br><br><strong><em>Illithid Creations.</em></strong> Mind flayers breed intellect devourers to serve as roaming hunters of the Underdark, creating an intellect devourer by taking the brain of a thrall and subjecting it to a horrible ritual. As it sprouts legs, the brain becomes an intelligent predator as twisted and evil as its masters.<br><br><strong><em>Deadly Puppet Masters.</em></strong> An intellect devourer consumes a creature’s mind and memories, then turns the host body into a puppet under its control. An intellect devourer typically uses its puppet host to lure others into the domain of the mind flayers to be enthralled or consumed.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Detect Sentience</strong>: The intellect devourer can sense the presence and location of any creature within 300 feet of it that has an Intelligence of 3 or higher, regardless of interposing barriers, unless the creature is protected by a mind blank spell.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The intellect devourer makes one attack with its claws and uses Devour Intellect.<br><br><strong>Claws</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Devour Intellect</strong>: The intellect devourer targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it that has a brain. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw against this magic or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. Also on a failure, roll 3d6: If the total equals or exceeds the target’s Intelligence score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until it regains at least one point of Intelligence.<br><br><strong>Body Thief</strong>: The intellect devourer initiates an Intelligence contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it that isn’t protected by <em>protection from evil and good</em>. If it wins the contest, the intellect devourer magically consumes the target’s brain, teleports into the skull, and takes control of the body. While there, the intellect devourer has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of Deep Speech, its telepathy, and its traits. It otherwise adopts the target’s statistics. It knows everything the creature knew, including spells and languages.<br><br>If the host body dies, the intellect devourer must leave it. A <em>protection from evil and good</em> spell cast on the body drives the intellect devourer out. The intellect devourer is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a <em>wish</em>. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-73af91d1-fde3-63c2-691a-db615267de1a\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">An <b>intellect devourer</b> in league with Xanathar ate Meloon's brain several months ago.

Others are overcome with madness or stand paralyzed, fixated on the horrific creature as it oozes forward to consume them.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAll-Consuming.</em></strong> Driven to devour any creature it can reach, a gibbering mouther flows over victims transfixed by its mad ranting, its multitudinous voices temporarily silenced as it gnaws and swallows living flesh. The monster liquefies stone with which it comes into contact, hindering creatures that overcome its gibbering and attempt to flee.<br><br>\n\tA gibbering mouther leaves nothing of its prey behind. However, even as the last of a victim’s body is consumed, its eyes and mouth boil to the surface, ready to join the chorus of tormented gibbering that welcomes the monster’s next meal.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Aberrant Ground</strong>: The ground in a 10-foot radius around the mouther is doughlike difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.<br><br><strong>Gibbering</strong>: The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn't incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can't make such an attack.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The gibbering mouther makes one bite attack and, if it can, uses its Blinding Spittle.<br><br><strong>Bites</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit</em>: 17 (5d6) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is killed by this damage, it is absorbed into the mouther.<br><br><strong>Blinding Spittle (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The mouther spits a chemical glob at a point it can see within 15 feet of it. The glob explodes in a blinding flash of light on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the flash must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the mouther's next turn.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-cc836791-fdc8-38ba-b010-0168a9d6c4f5\"></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">There is one <b>gibbering mouther</b> guarding a treasure chest in area B11b.</span></p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral","race":"","type":"aberration","environment":"","cr":2,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":450},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["prone"],"custom":""},"senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"passive":6},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"passive":6},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"passive":6},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"passive":6},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"passive":6},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NmU5YzIxZWRkN2Yx","sort":550000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/055_-_Gibbering_Mouther/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Gibbering Mouther","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/055_-_Gibbering_Mouther/token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"OGIxMzBjOGNhM2U5","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":67,"max":67},"bar2":{"value":9,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"OTZiOWMzZGNlNDdj","flags":{},"name":"Aberrant Ground.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/055_-_Gibbering_Mouther/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The ground in a 10-foot radius around the mouther is doughlike difficult terrain.

They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks. The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze’s presence is often the searing pain of its acidic touch.<br><br>\n\tOozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Slow Death.</em></strong> An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim’s comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.<br><br>\n\tSince not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Unwitting Servants.</em></strong> Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze’s need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Spawn of Juiblex.</em></strong> According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex. Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Ooze Nature.</em></strong> An ooze doesn’t require sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Gray Ooze</h2>\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/27611725/82HXFOCy0uQ1iu5IuCTHmg/med.png?1484858501\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\">A gray ooze is stone turned to liquid by chaos. When it moves, it slithers like a liquid snake, rising to strike.<br><br>\n\n\n<h3>Variant: Psychic Gray Ooze</h3>\nA gray ooze that lives a long time can evolve to become more intelligent and develop limited psionic ability. Such occurrences are more common in gray oozes that live near psionic creatures such as mind flayers, suggesting that the ooze can sense and mimic psionic ability.

In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.<br><br>\n\tEvil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCurse of Lycanthropy.</em></strong> A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A <em>remove curse</em> spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish.<br><br>\n\tA lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form—or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.<br><br>\n\tSome individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Wererat</h2>\nWererats are cunning lycanthropes with sly, avaricious personalities. They are wiry and twitchy in humanoid form, with thin hair and darting eyes. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, wererats prefer light weapons and use ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although a wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form, it favors that form for stealthy infiltration and escape rather than combat.<br><br>\n\tA wererat clan operates much like a thieves’ guild, with wererats transmitting their curse only to creatures they want to induct into the clan. Wererats that are accidentally cursed or break loose from the clan’s control are quickly hunted down and killed.<br><br>\n\tWererat clans are found throughout urban civilization, often dwelling in cellars and catacombs. These creatures are common in the sewers beneath major cities, viewing those subterranean areas as their hunting grounds. Rats and giant rats are commonly found living among wererats.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Variant: Nonhuman Lycanthropes</h2>\nThe statistics presented in this section assume a base creature of human. However, you can also use the statistics to represent nonhuman lycanthropes, adding verisimilitude by allowing a nonhuman lycanthrope to retain one or more of its humanoid racial traits. For example, an elf werewolf might have the Fey Ancestry trait.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Player Characters as Lycanthropes</h2>\nA character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics except as specified by lycanthrope type. The character gains the lycanthrope’s speeds in nonhumanoid form, damage immunities, traits, and actions that don’t involve equipment. The character is proficient with the lycanthrope’s natural attacks, such as its bite or claws, which deal damage as shown in the lycanthrope’s statistics. The character can’t speak while in animal form.<br><br>\n\tA humanoid hit by an attack that carries the curse of lycanthropy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + the lycanthrope’s proficiency bonus + the lycanthrope’s Constitution modifier) or be cursed. If the character embraces the curse, his or her alignment becomes the one defined for the lycanthrope. The DM is free to decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control until the curse of lycanthropy is removed.<br><br>\n\tThe following information applies to specific lycanthropes.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWerebear.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of 19 if his or her score isn’t already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while in bear or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for the natural weapons are based on Strength.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWereboar.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of 17 if his or her score isn’t already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while in boar or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for the tusks are based on Strength. For the Charge trait, the DC is 8 + the character’s proficiency bonus + Strength modifier.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWererat.</em></strong> The character gains a Dexterity of 15 if his or her score isn’t already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the bite are based on whichever is higher of the character’s Strength and Dexterity.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWeretiger.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of 17 if his or her score isn’t already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the natural weapons are based on Strength. For the Pounce trait, the DC is 8 + the character’s proficiency bonus + Strength modifier.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWerewolf.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of 15 if his or her score isn’t already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while in wolf or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for the natural weapons are based on Strength.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The wererat can use its action to polymorph into a rat-humanoid hybrid or into a giant rat, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br><strong>Keen Smell</strong>: The wererat has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only)</strong>: The wererat makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite.<br><br><strong>Bite (Rat or Hybrid Form Only).</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

Land folk and merfolk rarely meet except by chance, though star-eyed mariners tell tales of romance with these creatures along the shoals of faraway islands.<br><br>\n\tMerfolk lack the materials and practical means to forge weapons beneath the waves, to write books and keep lore, or to shape stone to raise buildings and cities. As a result, most live in small hunter-gatherer tribes, each of which holds unique values and creeds. Only occasionally do merfolk unite under the rule of a single leader. They do so to face a common threat or to complete a conquest. Such unifications can be the beginning of undersea kingdoms with dynasties lasting hundreds of years.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Merfolk Settlements.</em></strong> Merfolk build their settlements in vast undersea caverns, mazes of coral, the ruins of sunken cities, or structures they carve from the rocky seabed. They live in water shallow enough that the passage of time can be marked by the gleam and fade of sunlight through the water. In the reefs and trenches near their settlements, merfolk harvest coral and farm the seabed, shepherding schools of fish as land-based farmers tend sheep. Only rarely do merfolk venture into the darkest depths of the ocean. In such depths and in their undersea caverns, merfolk rely on the light of bioluminescent flora and fauna, such as jellyfish, whose slow pulsing movements lend merfolk settlements an otherworldly aesthetic.<br><br>\n\tMerfolk defend their communities with spears crafted from whatever materials they can salvage from shipwrecks, beaches, and dead undersea creatures.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Amphibious</strong>: The merfolk can breathe air and water.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Spear (Melee; One-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 3 (1d6) piercing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Spear (Melee; Two-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 4 (1d8) piercing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Spear (Ranged; One-Handed)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +2 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 3 (1d6) piercing damage.</p><hr>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-58721525-01be-e7d1-89c5-5829845629f5\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The control room has two levels: an observation deck (U7a) and a command center (U7b), with two ladders running between levels.

It might seek to avenge its own death, fulfill an oath, or relay a message to a loved one. A ghost might not realize that it has died and continue the everyday routine of its life. Others are driven by wickedness or spite, as with a ghost that refuses to rest until every member of a certain family or organization is dead.<br><br>\n\tThe surest way to rid an area of a ghost is to resolve its unfinished business. A ghost can be destroyed more easily by invoking a weakness tied to its former life. The ghost of a person tortured to death might be killed again by the implements of that torture. The ghost of a gardener might become more vulnerable when exposed to a potent floral fragrance.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tGhostly Manifestations.</em></strong> Sensations of profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled yearning emanate from places where ghostly hauntings occur. Strange sounds or unnatural silences create an unsettling atmosphere. Cold spots settle in rooms that have roaring fires. A choking stench might seep into the area, inanimate objects might move of their own accord, and corpses might rise from the grave. The ghost has no control over these manifestations; they simply occur.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUndead Nature.</em></strong> A ghost doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Ethereal Sight</strong>: The ghost can see 60 ft. into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.<br><br><strong>Incorporeal Movement</strong>: The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Withering Touch</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage.<br><br><strong>Etherealness</strong>: The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.<br><br><strong>Horrifying Visage</strong>: Each non-undead creature within 60 ft. of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 x 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a <em>greater restoration</em> spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.<br><br><strong>Possession (Recharge 6)</strong>: One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 ft. of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.<br><br>The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Malkolm Brizzenbright, a ghost, greets all visitors in the lobby (area P1). Dressed in a suit, his hair unkempt, he floats in plain sight most of the time, waving his hands about in gestures of greeting and salutation. Locals are accustomed to his spectral form and his stock introduction:<br><br>“Let not this harried visage diminish you, gentlesirs and beautiful ladies, for I am but your friendly host. What fine art have we wrought for you this day? Buy your tickets and behold! You shan't be disappointed!”<br></span><br>The <b>ghost</b> can engage in light conversation. It is bound to the theater because Malkolm Brizzenbright's soul couldn't bear to leave the place. If the theater were to close down, the ghost would haunt it still, perhaps becoming more deranged over time. Only razing or burning the theater to the ground can force his spirit to depart forever.</p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The spirits of several dead members of the Cassa­lanter family are bound to this crypt. They manifest as three dark, vaporous specters plus a <b>ghost </b>that looks like the insubstantial image of a handsome, clean-shaven man of knightly bearing clad in plate armor. These undead attack any living creatures but can't leave the crypt or approach within 5 feet of any creature that wears a holy symbol of Asmodeus.\n</span>\nThe ghost is all that remains of Caladorn Cassalanter, a former Masked Lord and hero of Waterdeep. The ghost halts its attack and calls off the specters if a character wears or presents a holy symbol of Siamorphe. After it is shown such a symbol, the ghost guides characters to its personal crypt (area A4a).</p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-b8569a31-fdc5-9074-f38a-5704945d172a\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">This short avenue from Caravan Court to the Trollwall in the Southern Ward is haunted by the hooded <b>ghost </b>of the mage Ruid, whose touch causes deathly chills to those he meets on foggy nights.

Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist only to destroy.<br><br><strong><em>Spawn of Chaos.</em></strong> The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26078751/KlZRu6G4cK-cSNmLbXXRWw/med.jpg?1481223347\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\"><strong><em>Capricious Elevation.</em></strong> Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon’s status grows with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.<br><br>A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.<br><br>By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a demon’s deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.<br><br><strong><em>Abyssal Invasions.</em></strong> Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin.<br><br>Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.<br><br><strong><em>Signs of Corruption.</em></strong> Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.<br><br><strong><em>Eternal Evil.</em></strong> Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can’t stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor. It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed. The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the Abyss and kill it there.<br><br><strong><em>Protected Essence.</em></strong> A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon’s abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.<br><br>Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holds—or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.<br><br><strong><em>Demonic Cults.</em></strong> Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord’s ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.<br><br><strong><em>Demon Summoning.</em></strong> Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.<br><br>Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another’s will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.<br><br><strong><em>Bound Demons.</em></strong> <em>The Book of Vile Darkness</em>, the <em>Black Scrolls of Ahm</em>, and the <em>Demonomicon of Iggwilv</em> are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend’s return to the Abyss.<br><br>An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.<br><br><strong><em>Demonic Possession.</em></strong> No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.<br><br>As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.<br><br>\n<h2>Demon True Names</h2>Though demons all have common names, every demon lord and every demon of type 1 through 6 has a true name that it keeps secret. A demon can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the true names of the most powerful demons.<br><br>A mortal who learns a demon’s true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the demon from the Abyss and exercise some measure of control over it. However, most demons brought to the Material Plane in this manner do everything in their power to wreak havoc or sow discord and strife.<br><br><h2>Demon Lords</h2>The chaotic power of the Abyss rewards demons of particular ruthlessness and ingenuity with a dark blessing, transforming them into unique fiends whose power can rival the gods. These demon lords rule through cunning or brute force, hoping to one day claim the prize of absolute control over all the Abyss.<br><br><strong><em>Reward for Outsiders.</em></strong> Although most demon lords rise up from the vast and uncountable mobs of demons rampaging across the Abyss, the plane also rewards outsiders that conquer any of its infinite layers. The elven goddess Lolth became a demon lord after Corellon Larethian cast her into the Abyss for betraying elvenkind. Sages claim that the Dark Prince Graz’zt originated on some other plane before stealing his abyssal title from another long-forgotten demon lord.<br><br><strong><em>Power and Control. </em></strong>The greatest sign of a demon lord’s power is its ability to reshape an abyssal realm. A layer of the Abyss controlled by a demon lord becomes a twisted reflection of that fiend’s vile personality, and demon lords seldom leave their realms for fear of allowing another creature to reshape and seize it.<br><br>As with other demons, a demon lord that dies on another plane has its essence return to the Abyss, where it reforms into a new body. Likewise, a demon lord that dies in the Abyss is permanently destroyed. Most demon lords keep a portion of their essence safely stored away to prevent such a fate.<br><br><h3>Baphomet</h3>The demon lord Baphomet, also known as the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts, rules over minotaurs and other savage creatures. If he had his way, civilization would crumble and all races would embrace their base animal savagery.<br><br>The Prince of Beasts appears as a huge, black-furred minotaur with iron horns, red eyes, and a blood-soaked mouth. His iron crown is topped with the rotting heads of his enemies, while his dark armor is set with spikes and skull-like serrations. He carries a huge glaive named Heartcleaver, but often hurls it into the fray so as to face his enemies with horns and hooves.<br><br><h3>Demogorgon</h3>The Sibilant Beast and the self-styled Prince of Demons, Demogorgon yearns for nothing less than undoing the order of the multiverse. An insane assemblage of features and drives, the Prince of Demons inspires fear and hatred among other demons and demon lords.<br><br>Demogorgon towers three times the height of a human, his body as sinuous as a snake’s and as powerful as a great ape’s. Suckered tentacles take the place of his arms. His saurian lower torso ends in webbed and clawed feet, and a forked tail whose whip-like tips are armed with cruel blades. The Prince of Demons has two baleful baboon heads, both of them mad. It is only the conflict between the two halves of his dual nature that keeps the demon lord’s ambitions in check.<br><br><h3>Graz’zt</h3>The demon lord Graz’zt appears as a darkly handsome figure nearly nine feet tall. Those who refer to the Dark Prince as the most humanoid of the demon lords vastly underestimate the capacity for evil in his scheming heart.<br><br>Graz’zt is a striking physical specimen, whose demonic nature shows in his ebon skin, pointed ears, yellow fangs, crown of horns, and six-fingered hands. He delights in finery, pageantry, and sating his decadent desires with subjects and consorts alike, among whom incubi and succubi are often his favorites.<br><br><h3>Juiblex</h3>The demon lord of slimes and oozes, Juiblex is a stew of noxious fluids that lurks in the abyssal depths. The wretched Faceless Lord cares nothing for cultists or mortal servants, and its sole desire is to turn all creatures into formless copies of its horrid self.<br><br>In its resting state, Juiblex spreads out in a noxious mass, bubbling and filling the air with a profound stench. On the rare occasions when creatures confront the demon lord, Juiblex draws itself up into a shuddering cone of slime striated with veins of black and green. Baleful red eyes swim within its gelatinous body, while dripping pseudopods of ooze lash out hungrily at any creature they can reach.<br><br><h3>Lolth</h3>The Demon Queen of Spiders is the evil matron of the drow. Her every thought is touched by malice, and the depth of her viciousness can surprise even her most faithful priestesses. She directs her faithful while she weaves plots across the worlds of the Material Plane, looking forward to the time when her drow followers bring those worlds under her control.<br><br>Lolth appears as a lithe, imperious drow matriarch when she manifests to her followers in the mortal realm, which she does with unusual frequency. When battle breaks out—or if she has a reason to remind her followers to fear her—Lolth’s lower body transforms into that of a huge demonic spider, whose spike-tipped legs and mandibles tear foes apart.<br><br><h3>Orcus</h3>Known as the Demon Prince of Undeath and the Blood Lord, the demon lord Orcus is worshiped by the undead and by living creatures that channel the power of undeath. A brooding and nihilistic entity, Orcus yearns to make the multiverse a place of death and darkness, forever unchanging except by his will.<br><br>The Demon Prince of Undeath is a foul and corpulent creature, with a humanoid torso, powerful goat legs, and the desiccated head of a ram. His sore-ridden body stinks of disease, but his decaying head and glowing red eyes are as a creature already dead. Great black bat wings sprout from his back, stirring reeking air as he moves.<br><br>Orcus wields a malevolent artifact known as the <em>Wand of Orcus</em>, a mace-like rod of obsidian topped by a humanoid skull. He surrounds himself with undead, and living creatures not under his control are anathema to him.<br><br><h3>Yeenoghu</h3>Known as the Gnoll Lord and the Beast of Butchery, the demon lord Yeenoghu hungers for slaughter and senseless destruction. Gnolls are his mortal instruments, and he drives them to ever-greater atrocities in his name. Delighting in sorrow and hopelessness, the Gnoll Lord yearns to turn the world into a wasteland in which the last surviving gnolls tear each other apart for the right to feast upon the dead.<br><br>Yeenoghu appears as a huge, scarred gnoll with a spiky crest of black spines, and eyes that burn with emerald flame. His armor is a patchwork of shields and breastplates claimed from fallen foes, and decorated by those foes’ flayed skins. Yeenoghu can summon a triple flail he calls the Butcher, which he wields to deadly effect or wills to fly independently into battle as he tears foes apart with teeth and claws.<br><br><h3>Other Demon Lords</h3>No one knows the full number of demon lords that rage in the Abyss. Given the infinite depths of that plane, powerful demons constantly rise to become demon lords, then fall almost as quickly. Among the demon lords whose power has endured long enough for demonologists to name them are Fraz-Urb’luu, the Prince of Deception; Kostchtchie, the Prince of Wrath; Pazuzu, Prince of the Lower Aerial Kingdoms; and Zuggtmoy, Lady of Fungi.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Shadow Demon</h2>When a demon’s body is destroyed but the fiend is prevented from reforming in the Abyss, its essence sometimes takes on a vague physical form. These shadow demons exist outside the normal abyssal hierarchy, since their creation results most often from mortal magic, not from transformation or promotion.<br><br>\n\tShadow demons all but disappear in the darkness, and they can creep about without making a sound. A shadow demon uses its insubstantial claws to feast on its victim’s fears, to taste its memories, and drink in its doubts. Bright light harries this fiend and shows its distinct shape, resolving it from a blur of darkness to a winged humanoid creature whose lower body trails off into nothing, and whose claws rend a victim’s mind.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tShadowy Nature.</em></strong> A shadow demon doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n\n\n<br><br><h2>Demon Types</h2>Demonologists organize the chaotic distribution of demons into broad categories of power known as types. Most demons fit into one of six major types, with the weakest categorized as Type 1 and the strongest as Type 6. Demons outside the six main types are categorized as minor demons and demon lords.<br><br><h3>Demons by Type</h3><table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Type</td>\n<td>Examples</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>barlgura, shadow demon, vrock</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>chasme, hezrou</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>glabrezu, yochlol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>nalfeshnee</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>marilith</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>balor, goristro</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>\n\nIncorporeal Movement</strong>: The demon can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain.

When they attack, griffons are as swift and deadly as eagles, even as they strike with a lion’s savage might and grace.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHorse Eaters.</em></strong> Griffons hunt in small prides, flying high over plains and forests near their rocky cliff-side aeries. Herd animals and horses are the prey they crave above all others, though they also hunt and kill hippogriffs. When it spots horses, a griffon screeches to alert its pride mates, which descend quickly toward their prey.<br><br>\n\tThose riding or herding horses dread the griffon’s piercing cry, preparing themselves for the bloody fight that inevitably follows. A griffon ignores a horse’s rider when possible, and a rider that abandons its mount, or a herder that releases one or two horses, can escape unharmed while the griffon targets its chosen prey. Riders who attempt to protect their horses attract the full fury of an attacking griffon.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSky Dwellers.</em></strong> Griffons lair in high rocky clifftop aeries, building their nests from sticks, leaves, and the bones of their prey. Once griffons establish a territory, they remain in that area until the food supply has been exhausted.<br><br>\n\tAggressive and territorial, griffons engage in brutal aerial combat to defend their aeries, tearing and shredding the wings of flying intruders to send them spiraling to the ground. Creatures that climb to a griffon’s lair are plucked from the cliffs and eaten, or are knocked from the heights to go tumbling to their deaths.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTrained Mounts.</em></strong> A griffon raised from an egg can be trained to serve as a mount. However, such training is time consuming, expensive (mostly for the ample food the creature requires), and dangerous. Expert trainers well versed in the griffon’s legendary ferocity are typically the only ones able to raise these creatures safely.<br><br>\n\tOnce trained, a griffon is a fierce and loyal steed. It bonds with one master for life, fighting to the death to protect that rider. A griffon mount retains its ravenous appetite for horseflesh, and a wise master ensures that a griffon remains satiated with other prey when passing through civilized lands.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Keen Sight</strong>: The griffon has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The griffon makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its claws.<br><br><strong>Beak</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Claws</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-f18a4dc6-fdd1-bf72-91d3-9f37ec3b677e\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The Belabrantas are a Waterdavian noble family that raises <b>griffons</b> for the Griffon Cavalry. Savra is trying to regain her honor by serving Tyr, thus atoning for the evil acts she committed as a member of an evil elemental cult called the Howling Hatred. Savra's sins are irrelevant to this adventure, but you can learn more about her past in Princes of the Apocalypse. Whenever she has a mission for the characters, she communicates the missive to them herself.</span></span></p><hr><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-f18a4dc6-fdd1-bf72-91d3-9f37ec3b677e\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-9d534320-fdd2-1980-c81c-dac704a7ab9b\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The characters have a few minutes to examine the crime scene before the City Guard arrives and cordons off Trollskull Alley, posting six guards at each entrance. The guards don't allow anyone in or out without permission from a superior officer. Another six guards, including a sergeant, make their way to the crime scene and watch over the dead bodies until the City Watch arrives. Lingering smoke from the fireball also attracts a Griffon Cavalry rider. As its <b>griffon </b>mount circles the neighborhood, the rider watches the streets and alleys for suspicious figures.</span></span></span></span></p><hr><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-f18a4dc6-fdd1-bf72-91d3-9f37ec3b677e\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-9d534320-fdd2-1980-c81c-dac704a7ab9b\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-d06f4411-fdd4-a0f3-12be-cd691bcc4010\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">A character mounted on a <b>griffon</b> can complete a city-wide search in a couple of hours. To secure the use of a griffon, a character must either be a member of the Order of the Gauntlet on good terms with Savra Belabranta or a member of the Lords' Alliance on good terms with Jalester Silvermane. As it happens, a young griffon named Bonesnapper is being trained to serve as a mount in the Griffon Cavalry. If Savra or Jalester is inclined to help the party, the characters can arrange to meet the griffon and its trainer outside the River Gate the following morning shortly after dawn. (The griffon and its trainer normally reside in Peaktop Aerie atop Mount Waterdeep, but most civilians aren't welcome there.) To gain Bonesnapper's trust, a character must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. The griffon won't allow any character who fails the check to ride it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><hr><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-f18a4dc6-fdd1-bf72-91d3-9f37ec3b677e\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-9d534320-fdd2-1980-c81c-dac704a7ab9b\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-d06f4411-fdd4-a0f3-12be-cd691bcc4010\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-1e9658e3-fdd5-22a2-7fb4-e539f79b552b\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Even if the bloody conflict at Gralhund Villa goes unnoticed outside the walls of the estate, the carnage can't be hidden from the City Watch for long. There are too many murdered servants and guards for anyone to conceal what has transpired. The arrival of the City Watch foreshadows the return of Barnibus Blastwind and Saeth Cromley, who arrive in due course with twenty constables (veterans) and two Griffon Cavalry riders astride griffons. The <b>griffons</b> and their riders remain airborne, providing aerial support and reconnaissance.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Waterdeep doesn't have the fabled flying ships of Halruaa, but it does deploy an aerial defense force. Brave warriors of the City Guard light out from the Peaktop Aerie atop Mount Waterdeep, riding fearsome <b>griffons </b>that have been bred and trained for that purpose. Each of the riders is equipped with a <i>ring of feather falling</i>—not merely to prevent death from mishap, but to allow them to perform stunning feats of aerial acrobatics.\n<br></span><br>In both martial displays and in real battles against flying threats such as manticores, harpies, and outlaw wizards, the griffon riders actually leap off their mounts into the open air! For a breath-stealing moment, they fall like stones, closing in on their targets at incredible speed. Their opponents rarely see the death blow, distracted as they are by other mounted griffon riders. When they are past the danger, the free-falling riders then suddenly halt in the air, drifting like feathers until their griffon companions swoop in and they regain their saddles. Working in concert with one another in this fashion, members of the Griffon Cavalry can rapidly eliminate any threat to the city—and even catch the body of the offender before it hits the rooftops below.<br><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\">\nRiders of the Griffon Cavalry are trained to stay above the rooftops, not because they fear

They can consume any living creature, but they are especially drawn to creatures untainted by evil. A creature that lives a life of goodness and piety consigns its basest impulses and strongest temptations to the darkness where the shadows hunger. As a shadow drains its victim’s strength and physical form, the victim’s shadow darkens and begins to move of its own volition. In death, the creature’s shadow breaks free, becoming a new undead shadow hungry for more life to consume.<br><br>\n\tIf a creature from which a shadow has been created somehow returns to life, its undead shadow senses the return. The shadow might seek its “parent” to vex or slay. Whether the shadow pursues its living counterpart, the creature that birthed the shadow no longer casts one until the monster is destroyed.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A shadow doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Amorphous</strong>: The shadow can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Shadow Stealth</strong>: While in dim light or darkness, the shadow can take the Hide action as a bonus action. Its stealth bonus is also improved to +6.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Sunlight Weakness</strong>: While in sunlight, the shadow has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Strength Drain</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.<br><br>If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a new shadow rises from the corpse 1d4 hours later.","public":""},"alignment":"Chaotic Evil","race":"","type":"undead","environment":"","cr":0.5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":100},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["necrotic","poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["acid","cold","fire","lightning","thunder"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":["radiant"],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["exhaustion","frightened","grappled","paralyzed","petrified","poisoned","prone","restrained"],"custom":""},"senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NmU5YzIxZWRkN2Yx","sort":750000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/075_-_Shadow/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Shadow","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/075_-_Shadow/token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"Y2ExOTFiMDhmNjVk","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":16,"max":16},"bar2":{"value":12,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"YjYxZjEzNWE4Mzcy","flags":{},"name":"Amorphous.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/075_-_Shadow/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The shadow can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":"","long":"","units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":0,"charged":false}},"sort":10000},{"_id":"Njg3YzIwOThiMzNk","flags":{},"name":"Shadow Stealth.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/075_-_Shadow/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>While in dim light or darkness, the shadow can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

Few creatures spread fear, suspicion, and deceit better than doppelgangers. Found in every land and culture, they can take on the guise of any individual of any race.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tStealing Secrets.</em></strong> A doppelganger’s adopted form allows it to blend into almost any group or community, but its transformation doesn’t impart languages, mannerisms, memory, or personality. Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature’s surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature’s name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger impersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and close at hand for weeks, probing the victim’s mind daily to learn how to behave and speak authentically.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHedonistic Swindlers.</em></strong> Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con to con. While one doppelganger takes the place of a murdered merchant or noble, the others take on a number of identities as circumstances warrant, playing the parts of family or servants while they live off the victim’s riches.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tChangelings.</em></strong> Doppelgangers are too lazy or self-interested to raise their young. They assume attractive male forms and seduce women, leaving them to raise their progeny. A doppelganger child appears to be a normal member of its mother’s species until it reaches adolescence, at which point it discovers its true nature and is driven to seek out its kind to join them.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br><strong>Ambusher</strong>: In the first round of a combat, the doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.<br><br><strong>Surprise Attack</strong>: If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Read Thoughts</strong>: The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><b>Willifort Crowelle </b>dresses in a sharp black suit and wears thin-rimmed spectacles.

Though little more than animated energy on their own planes of existence, they can be called on by spellcasters and powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tLiving Elements.</em></strong> On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tConjured by Magic.</em></strong> Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner Planes to the Material Plane. Elementals instinctively resent being pulled from their native planes and bound into service. A creature that summons an elemental must assert force of will to control it.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tBound and Shaped.</em></strong> Powerful magic can bind an elemental spirit into a material template that defines a specific use and function. Invisible stalkers are air elementals bound to a specific form, in the same way that water elementals can be shaped into water weirds.<br><br>\n\tThe strength of the magic and materials that bind an elemental determines how well the elemental functions in a bound form. Golems are elemental spirits bound to physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and clay can’t bind elemental power sufficiently. Durable materials such as stone and iron require stronger magic, which consequently binds an elemental more securely.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tElemental Nature.</em></strong> An elemental doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Earth Elemental</h2>\nAn earth elemental plods forward like a walking hill, club-like arms of jagged stone swinging at its sides.

Born into the mortal realm by demonic rites, minotaurs are savage conquerors and carnivores that live for the hunt. Their brown or black fur is stained with the blood of fallen foes, and they carry the stench of death.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>The Beast Within.</em></strong> Most minotaurs are solitary carnivores that roam labyrinthine dungeons, twisting caves, primeval woods, and the maze-like streets and passages of desolate ruins. A minotaur can visualize every route it might take to close the distance to its prey.<br><br>\n\tThe scent of blood, the tearing of flesh, and the cracking of bones spur a minotaur’s lust for carnage, overwhelming all thought and reason. In a blood rage, a minotaur charges anything it sees, butting and goring like a battering ram, then chopping the fallen in twain.<br><br>\n\tApart from ambushing creatures that wander into its labyrinth, a minotaur cares little for strategy or tactics. Minotaurs seldom organize, they don’t respect authority or hierarchy, and they are notoriously difficult to enslave, let alone control.<br><br>\n\t<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26019161/WNqdzyClKBYLz3KE75ZT1w/med.jpg?1481060263\" width=\"300\" align=\"left\"><strong><em>Cults of the Horned King.</em></strong> Minotaurs are the dark descendants of humanoids transformed by the rituals of cults that reject the oppression of authority by returning to nature. Inductees often mistake these cults for druidic circles or totemic religions whose ceremonies involve entering a labyrinth while wearing a ceremonial animal mask.<br><br>\n\tWithin these bounded environments, cultists hunt, kill, and eat wild beasts, indulging their basest primal urges. In the end, however, sacrificial animals are exchanged for humanoid sacrifice—sometimes an inductee that tried to escape the cult after learning its secrets. These labyrinths become blood-soaked halls of slaughter, echoing to the cultists’ savagery.<br><br>\n \tUnknown to all but their highest-ranking leaders, these mystery cults are creations of the demon lord Baphomet, the Horned King, whose layer of the Abyss is a gigantic labyrinth. Some of his followers are fervent supplicants that plead for strength and power. Others come to the cult seeking a life free from authority’s chains—and are liberated of their humanity instead as Baphomet transforms them into the minotaurs that echo his own savage form.<br><br>\n\tAlthough they begin as creations of the Horned King, minotaurs can breed true with one another, giving rise to an independent race of Baphomet’s savage children in the world.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Charge</strong>: If the minotaur moves at least 10 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage.

The foremost inhabitants of this inhospitable plane are the toad-like slaadi. Slaadi are undisciplined and have no formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger ones under threat of annihilation.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>The Spawning Stone.</em></strong> Long ago, Primus, overlord of the modrons, created a gigantic, geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone’s power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus’s creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus’s massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.<br><br>\n\tThe slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, Primus stands by his creation and either doesn’t perceive the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Birth and Transformation.</em></strong> Slaadi have horrific cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Shapechangers.</em></strong> Some slaadi can transform into the humanoid creatures from which they were originally spawned. These slaadi return to the Material Plane to sow discord in the guise of their former selves.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2> Red Slaad</h2>\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26546263/DGtQjFWSjv1y09wNkiRDHg/med.png?1482357131\" align=\"right\">When a red slaad claws a humanoid creature, it can inject an egg from a gland under one of its claws. The egg works its way into its host and gestates, eventually forming a slaad tadpole. Such a tadpole then eats its way out of the host’s body, feeds on the host’s remains, and then seeks any other fresh meat it can find. The tadpole transforms into a fully grown blue slaad — or green slaad if the host had the ability to cast 3rd level spells or higher — within 2d12 hours.\n<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Variant: Slaad Control Gems</h2>\nAs a slaad emerges from the Spawning Stone, the stone magically implants a fragment of itself in the slaad’s brain. This fragment takes the form of a magic gem roughly the size and shape of a human child’s fist. The gem is the same color as the slaad. Another creature can use magic to draw forth a slaad’s gem and use it to subjugate the slaad. The slaad must obey whoever possesses its gem. If a slaad’s gem is destroyed, the slaad can no longer be controlled in this way.<br><br>\n\t<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26545544/VGTI7rbFkH6SP4BxURj9aQ/med.png?1482355708\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\">A slaad born from something other than the Spawning Stone has no gem in its brain, but it gains one if it ever comes into contact with the Spawning Stone. Slaadi on Limbo are attracted to the Spawning Stone, so most end up with a gem. A slaad with a control gem in its brain has the following additional trait.<br><br>\n\t<strong>Control Gem</strong>: Implanted in the slaad’s brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.<br><br>\n\tCertain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against <em>imprisonment</em>, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster’s open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A <em>wish</em> spell, if cast in the slaad’s presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.<br><br>\n\tA <em>greater restoration</em> spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.<br><br>\n\tSomeone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Regeneration</strong>: The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease — a minuscule slaad egg.<br><br>A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host’s chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.<br><br>If the disease is cured before the tadpole’s emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">A <i><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Dispel%20Magic#content\">detect magic</a></i> spell or similar magic reveals a powerful aura of conjuration magic around the rune.

They can perfectly imitate any sound they hear.<br><br><strong><em>Fallen Flocks.</em></strong> Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes, and rags. These garments cover the soft, sleek feathers of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs. They tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for grasping the branches of trees and seizing prey from the lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw attention to their shameful forms.<br><br>Once, the kenku held the wind in their wings, embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering baubles of his household, and longed to speak so that they could cajole and swindle others out of such treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume in their master’s library, they disguised themselves in rags to beg for pretty things. When their master learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as punishment, forcing them to beg forever.<br><br><strong><em>Speech in Pantomime.</em></strong> Kenku can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might make the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs, bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse.<br><br>Kenku speak to one another in much the same way. Because they are adept at interpreting one another’s glances and gestures, the sounds they make to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes. For example, a cat’s meow might be the secret code for “Prepare to attack!” or “Flee for your lives!”<br><br>Their talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might forge evidence to implicate another creature.<br><br><strong><em>The Wistful Wingless.</em></strong> All kenku pine for the ability to fly, and thus the punishments they mete out to one another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings of wood borne as a mark of shame. As a final, tragic reminder of the wings they once had, kenku carry out executions by hurling their condemned from tall buildings or cliffs.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Ambusher</strong>: The kenku has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.<br><br><strong>Mimicry</strong>: The kenku can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices.

Such terrifying cruelty. They are the vile poison that plagues all elvenkind.\"</em><br>—Nelar Autumnwell, elf cleric of Corellon Larethian</blockquote><br>\n\n<h2>Elves: Drow</h2>\nTens of thousands of years ago, the elves were divided, with those of benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves—the drow—found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26322810/Yh-mZ91x5frzYXZJ_Fp80Q/med.jpg?1481818797\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\"><strong><em>Children of Lolth.</em></strong> The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do.<br><br>\n\tThe wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCreatures of Darkness.</em></strong> The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUnderdark Cities.</em></strong> The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings.<br><br>\n\tA drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDrow Magic.</em></strong> Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tArms and Armor.</em></strong> Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCutthroat Politics.</em></strong> Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.<br><br>\n\tDrow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house’s social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMatriarchal Rule.</em></strong> Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.<br><br>\n\tIn drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow—either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can’t be priests, nor can they rule a house.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tPoison Predilection.</em></strong> Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.<br><br><h2>Drow Elite Warrior</h2>\nDrow elite warriors defend their houses and their superiors against all enemies, although they specialize in fighting dwarves, gnomes, and elves (including other drow). They frequently raid surface settlements under cover of night, returning to the Underdark with prisoners and spoils in tow before dawn.<br><br>\n\tElite warriors can be male or female.<br><br>\n\n\n<br><br>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26322823/8Gl25c25yxM2iYr6A-q4iw/med.jpg?1481818847\"></div><br>\n\n<h2>Variant: Drow Magic Armor and Weapons</h2>\nDrow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.<br><br>\n\tA <strong>drow</strong> wearing a <em>+1 chain shirt</em> and carrying a <em>+1 shortsword</em> has AC 19 and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.<br><br>\n\tA <strong>drow elite warrior</strong> wearing <em>+2 studded leather</em> and carrying a <em>+2 shortsword</em> has AC 20 and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.<br><br>\n\tA <strong>drow priestess of Lolth</strong> wearing <em>+3 scale mail</em> has AC 19.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Fey Ancestry</strong>: The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.<br><br><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The drow's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12).

If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.<br><br><h2>Reactions</h2><strong>Parry</strong>: The drow adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it.

They live by raiding, scavenging, and killing for food and pleasure. The average adult specimen stands between 9 and 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Furious Tempers.</em></strong> Ogres are notorious for their quick tempers, which flare at the smallest perceived offense. Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre’s wrath in an instant—as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Gruesome Gluttons.</em></strong> Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre?has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry’s skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Greedy Collectors.</em></strong> An ogre’s eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous “treasure” taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre’s trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Legendary Stupidity.</em></strong> Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don’t understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words—and then being eaten in turn.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Primitive Wanderers.</em></strong> Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and unwary farmers.<br><br>\n\tAn ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Ogre Gangs.</em></strong> Ogres sometimes band together in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism. When bands of ogres meet, one might attempt to capture the members of the other group to increase its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons.<br><br>\n\tWhenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants’ complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Half-Ogre</h2>\n\nWhen an ogre mates with a human, hobgoblin, bugbear, or orc, the result is always a half-ogre.

These strange, normally docile creatures corrode ferrous metals, then gobble up the rust they create. In doing so, they have ruined the armor, shields, and weapons of countless adventurers.<br><br>\n\tA rust monster’s body is covered in thick, lumpy armor, its long tail ends in a bony protrusion, and two feathery antennae sprout from its insectile head.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Underground Scavengers.</em></strong> Rust monsters roam subterranean passages in search of ferrous metals such as iron, steel, adamantine, and mithral to consume. They ignore creatures not carrying such metals, but can become aggressive toward those bearing steel weapons and armor. A rust monster can smell its food at a distance, immediately dashing toward the scent’s source to corrode and consume the object.<br><br>\n\tA rust monster doesn’t care if the rust it consumes comes from a spike or a sword. Adventurers can distract the creature by dropping ferrous objects behind them.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Subterranean Wanderers.</em></strong> Rust monsters are rarely found in large numbers, preferring to hunt alone or in small groups. They meander along tunnels, moving from cave to cave in their tireless search for ferrous metals to consume. Their wanderings often bring them into contact with other Underdark denizens that find them harmless or unappetizing. Thus, rust monsters may be found in close proximity to other subterranean monsters. If they are well treated and well fed, they can also become friendly companions or pets.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Iron Scent</strong>: The rust monster can pinpoint, by scent, the location of ferrous metal within 30 feet of it.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Rust Metal</strong>: Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the rust monster corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Non magical ammunition made of metal that hits the rust monster is destroyed after dealing damage.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Antennae</strong>: The rust monster corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal object it can see within 5 feet of it. If the object isn't being worn or carried, the touch destroys a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the rust monster's touch.<br><br>If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or carried, its takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers.

A bristling mane stretches down the creature’s back, and its long tail ends in a cluster of deadly spikes that can impale prey at impressive range.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Evil Predators.</em></strong> Manticores are fierce killers that hunt far and wide for prey. They work together to take down particularly large or dangerous creatures, sharing the meal once a kill is made. A manticore begins its attack with a volley of tail spikes, then lands and uses its claws and bite. When outdoors and outnumbered, it uses its wings to stay aloft, attacking from a distance until its spikes are depleted.<br><br>\n\tA manticore isn’t particularly bright, but it possesses a malevolent nature and the ability to converse. In the course of attacking, it denigrates its foes and offers to kill them swiftly if they beg for their lives. If a manticore sees an advantage to be gained by sparing a creature’s life, it does so, asking for a tribute or sacrifice equal to its loss of food.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Monstrous Relationships.</em></strong> Manticores serve wicked masters that treat them well and provide regular prey. A manticore might provide aerial support for an orc horde or a hobgoblin army. Another could serve as a hunting companion for a hill giant chief, or guard the entrance to a lamia’s lair.<br><br>\n\tThe manticores’ greatest territorial rivals include chimeras, griffons, perytons, and wyverns. Manticores hunting as a pack often have the advantage of greater numbers. In addition to these creatures, manticores fear dragons and avoid them.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Tail Spike Regrowth</strong>: The manticore has twenty-four tail spikes.

Not knowing what it was, they brought the artifact to their king. Everyone who touched the idol became afflicted with madness, including the king, who decreed that a sacrificial ritual be performed to open a gateway to the Abyss. The ocean turned red with the blood of slaughtered merfolk, but the ritual worked, and the king led the survivors through the underwater gate to Demogorgon’s layer of the Abyss.

Father and son detest one another, and Renaer is least happy when he finds himself forced to deal with some mess his father left behind. Qualities that both share include striking good looks, a love of drink, and a flair for diplomacy.

Approaching middle age, he has given up adventuring and settled down somewhat. As a Harper, he spends a lot of time defending Waterdavians against those who, like his father, would deprive them of their coin and rights. He owns Neverember House, a four-story residence in the Sea Ward. Renaer spends as little time there as possible, however, since it's constantly under surveillance by spies loyal to his father. His friends have an open invitation to use the house as they please, while Renaer spends most of his free time in taverns and festhalls.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br>Some believe that Renaer's estrangement from his father is nothing but an act, and that anyone who bears the Neverember name is an enemy of Waterdeep.

She's known as “the Gargoyle” because her face is frozen in a scowl that frightens adults and children alike. No one knows where she lives, but it's believed to be underground, possibly a cellar or dungeon under one of the city's oldest estates. She uses teleport spells to enter and leave her home, and she's never seen without her shield guardian close by.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">A little known fact is that Ulkoria once owned the tavern in Trollskull Alley. She sold it to a family of shield dwarves, who fell on hard times and sold it to a woman who made it into an orphanage. “Turned out to be a hag who was cooking and eating the children,” Ulkoria recalls. The estate passed through several more hands in the years that followed. Ulkoria hopes the new owners make something good of it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Anytime she passes through the North Ward, Ulkoria stops by the tavern for a drink and to check out the place while her shield guardian waits outside. If she doesn't like what the characters have done with the establishment, she keeps her criticisms to herself. The characters can hire her to cast glyphs of warding on the place, for which she charges 300 gp apiece.</span></p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Alignment","race":"","type":"humanoid (any race)","environment":"","cr":12,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":8400},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"passive Perception 12","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"arc":{"value":2,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":13,"passive":23},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"his":{"value":2,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":13,"passive":23},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":"4","max":4,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":"3","max":3,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":"3","max":3,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":"3","max":3,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":"3","max":3,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":"1","max":1,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":"1","max":1,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":"1","max":1,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":"1","max":1,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NmU5YzIxZWRkN2Yx","sort":330000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/033_-_Archmage/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Archmage","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/033_-_Archmage/token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":5,"brightSight":5,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"YjcxYzFjOWMxZWUx","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":99,"max":99},"bar2":{"value":12,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"OTVjMjIyZThhYmE2","flags":{},"name":"Magic Resistance.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/033_-_Archmage/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The archmage has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":"","long":"","units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":0,"charged":false}},"sort":10000},{"_id":"MTkzNjQzNTg2ZWEx","flags":{},"name":"Spellcasting.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/033_-_Archmage/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The archmage is an 18th-level spellcaster.

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. On Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to. Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

Having been awoken from its rest, it punishes transgressors with the power of its unholy curse.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Preserved Wrath.</em></strong> The long burial rituals that accompany a mummy’s entombment help protect its body from rot. In the embalming process, the newly dead creature’s organs are removed and placed in special jars, and its corpse is treated with preserving oils, herbs, and wrappings. After the body has been prepared, the corpse is typically wrapped in linen bandages.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>The Will of Dark Gods.</em></strong> An undead mummy is created when the priest of a death god or other dark deity ritually imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic magic. The mummy’s linen wrappings are inscribed with necromantic markings before the burial ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a mummy endures in undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by the ritual. Most commonly, a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>The Punished.</em></strong> Once deceased, an individual has no say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. Some mummies were powerful individuals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or who committed crimes of treason, adultery, or murder. As punishment, they were cursed with eternal undeath, embalmed, mummified, and sealed away. Other times, mummies acting as tomb guardians are created from slaves put to death specifically to serve a greater purpose.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Creature of Ritual.</em></strong> A mummy obeys the conditions and parameters laid down by the rituals that created it, driven only to punish transgressors. The overwhelming terror that foreshadows a mummy’s attack can leave the intended victim paralyzed with fright. In the days following a mummy’s touch, a victim’s body rots from the outside in, until nothing but dust remains.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Ending a Mummy’s Curse.</em></strong> Rare magic can undo or dispel the ritual that gave rise to a mummy, allowing it to truly die. More commonly, a mummy can be sent back to its endless rest by undoing the transgression that caused it to rise. A sacred idol might be replaced in its niche, a stolen treasure could be returned to its tomb, or a temple might be purified of despoiling bloodshed.<br><br>\n\tMore ephemeral or permanent offenses, such as revealing a secret the mummy wished kept or killing an individual the mummy loved, can’t be so easily remedied. In such cases, a mummy might slaughter all the creatures responsible and still not sate its wrath.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Undead Archives.</em></strong> Though they seldom bother to do so, mummies can speak. As a result, some serve as undead repositories of lost lore, and can be consulted by the descendants of those who created them. Powerful individuals sometimes intentionally sequester mummies away for occasional consultation.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A mummy doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one attack with its rotting fist.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Rotting Fist</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10, 3d6, for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Dreadful Glare</strong>: The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 ft. of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies, but not mummy lords, for the next 24 hours.<br><br>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Evil","race":"","type":"undead","environment":"","cr":3,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":700},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["necrotic","poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["bludgeoning","piercing"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":["fire"],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","exhaustion","frightened","paralyzed","poisoned"],"custom":""},"senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NmU5YzIxZWRkN2Yx","sort":2030000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/203_-_Mummy/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Mummy","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/203_-_Mummy/token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"YjgzMWUyZjE1MmUy","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":58,"max":58},"bar2":{"value":11,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"ZjA3N2ZhMGFiMmQ2","flags":{},"name":"Multiattack","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/203_-_Mummy/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><p><strong></strong>.</p><p>The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one attack with its rotting fist.</p></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":"","long":"","units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":0,"charged":false}},"sort":10000},{"_id":"YzUzNTFmNWFjMTZh","flags":{},"name":"Rotting Fist","type":"weapon","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/203_-_Mummy/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><p><strong></strong><em>Melee Weapon Attack </em>+5, Reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit : </em>10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.</p><p>If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot.

Like many other nobles, Esvele gossips about the Black Viper's exploits to lend credence to the villain's mystique.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The Rosznar family was convicted of slave trading—highly illegal in Waterdeep—and banished over a hundred years ago, but has since returned. The Rosznars' inability to regain the respect they feel they deserve rankles them. The slave trade has continued in Amn and elsewhere, and it's not like other noble houses don't have skeletons in their closets. But just because of a little family squabble that went public, the Rosznar name has been said with a sneer for a century. As part of the family's constant effort to prove this conception wrong and win others' respect, Esvele has been brought up to be the most proper noble possible, partaking in lessons of etiquette, dance, and poise as befits someone of her station.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">In her younger days, Esvele openly rebelled, but that behavior led to locked doors at night and house guards watching her every move during the day. So she taught herself how to pick locks, pluck keys from belts and pouches, clamber up walls, and sneak past guards—playing the perfect daughter by day while cutting loose at night. To hide her identity from those she met, she wore a hood and mask, exchanging her fine clothes for the kind of practical clothing her parents would never let her wear.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt ; line-height: 1.38\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span>One of the things Esvele has learned is to embrace the legend of the Black Viper. When she throws back her cloak to reveal the costume she has put together, most folk toss their purses and flee. If that doesn't work, she usually needs only to draw her dagger. Of course, some of the nobles she targets are made of sterner stuff, so Esvele has learned how to fight as well.

Psionic tyrants, slavers, and interdimensional voyagers, they are insidious masterminds that harvest entire races for their own twisted ends. Four tentacles snake from their octopus-like heads, flexing in hungry anticipation when sentient creatures come near.<br></div><br>\n\tIn eons past, illithids controlled empires that spanned many worlds. They subjugated and consequently warped whole races of humanoid slaves, including the githyanki and githzerai, the grimlocks, and the kuo-toa. Conjoined by a collective consciousness, the illithids hatch plots as far-reaching and evil as their fathomless minds can conceive.<br><br>\n\tSince the fall of their empires, illithid collectives on the Material Plane have resided in the Underdark.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Psionic Commanders.</em></strong> Mind flayers possess psionic powers that enable them to control the minds of creatures such as troglodytes, grimlocks, quaggoths, and ogres. Illithids prefer to communicate via telepathy and use their telepathy when issuing commands to their thralls.<br><br>\n\tWhen an illithid meets strong resistance, it avoids initial combat as it orders its thralls to attack. Like physical extensions of the illithid’s thoughts, these thralls interpose themselves between the mind flayer and its foes, sacrificing their lives so that their master can escape.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Hive Mind Colonies.</em></strong> Solitary mind flayers are likely rogues and outcasts. Most illithids belong to a colony of sibling mind flayers devoted to an elder brain—a massive brain-like being that resides in a briny pool near the center of a mind flayer community. From its pool, an elder brain telepathically dictates its desires to each individual mind flayer within 5 miles of it, for it is able to hold multiple mental conversations at once.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Hunger of the Mind.</em></strong> Illithids subsist on the brains of humanoids. The brains provide enzymes, hormones, and psychic energy necessary for their survival. An illithid healthy from a brain-rich diet secretes a thin glaze of mucus that coats its mauve skin.<br><br>\n\tAn illithid experiences euphoria as it devours the brain of a humanoid, along with its memories, personality, and innermost fears. Mind flayers will sometimes harvest a brain rather than devour it, using it as part of some alien experiment or transforming it into an intellect devourer.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Qualith</h2>\nOn the rare occasion that mind flayers need to write something down, they do so in Qualith. This system of tactile writing (similar to braille) is read by an illithid’s tentacles. Qualith is written in four-line stanzas and is so alien in construction that non-illithids must resort to magic to discern its meaning. Though Qualith can be used to keep records, illithids most often use it to mark portals or other surfaces with warnings or instructions.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The mind flayer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Innate Spellcasting (Psionics)</strong>: The mind flayer’s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:<br><br>\n• At will: <em>detect thoughts, levitate</em><br>\n• 1/day each: <em>dominate monster, plane shift </em>(self only)<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Tentacles</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (2d10 + 4) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled, escape DC 15, and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this grapple ends.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Extract Brain</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated humanoid grappled by the mind flayer. <em>Hit:</em> 55 (10d10) piercing damage. This attack can only be used on a incapacitated humanoid grappled by the mind flayer. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Mind Blast (Recharge 5–6)</strong>: The mind flayer magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (4d8 + 4) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">The illithid <b>Nihiloor</b> works for Xanathar, spending its days creating intellect devourers and setting them loose in the sewers of Waterdeep.

Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Slow Death.</em></strong> An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim’s comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.<br><br>\n\tSince not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Unwitting Servants.</em></strong> Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze’s need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Spawn of Juiblex.</em></strong> According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex. Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.<br><br>\n\t<strong><em>Ooze Nature.</em></strong> An ooze doesn’t require sleep.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Black Pudding</h2>\nA black pudding resembles a heaving mound of sticky black sludge. In dim passageways, the pudding appears to be little more than a blot of shadow.<br><br>\n\tFlesh, wood, metal, and bone dissolve when the pudding ebbs over them. Stone remains behind, wiped clean.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Amorphous</strong>: The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Corrosive Form</strong>: A creature that touches the pudding or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing damage.<br><br>\nThe pudding can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Spider Climb</strong>: The pudding can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Pseudopod</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage. In addition, nonmagical armor worn by the target is partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Reactions</h2>\n\n<strong>Split</strong>: When a pudding that is Medium or larger is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new puddings if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new pudding has hit points equal to half the original pudding's, rounded down. New puddings are one size smaller than the original pudding.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-8adb378d-fd16-dffc-6f6e-91edddfc518a\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">A little more than halfway down the hall in area V4, a section of the western mural has broken off, forming a heap of shattered tile on the floor.

Few creatures ever see the fiend in its true form, for it can take on any guise it wants, although it prefers to masquerade as someone powerful or influential: a noble, cardinal, or rich merchant, for example. A rakshasa’s true form combines the features of a human and a tiger, with one noteworthy deformity: its palms are where the backs of the hands would be on a human.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tEvil Spirits in Mortal Flesh.</em></strong> Rakshasas originated long ago in the Nine Hells, when powerful devils created a dark ritual to free their essence from their fiendish bodies in order to escape the Lower Planes. A rakshasa enters the Material Plane to feed its appetite for humanoid flesh and evil schemes. It selects its prey with care, taking pains to keep its presence in the world a secret.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tEvil Reborn.</em></strong> For a rakshasa, death on the Material Plane means an agonizing and torturous return to the Nine Hells, where its essence remains trapped until its body reforms—a process that can take months or years. When the rakshasa is reborn, it has all the memories and knowledge of its former life, and it seeks retribution against the one who slew it. If the target has somehow slipped through its grasp, the rakshasa might punish its killer’s family, friends, or descendants.<br><br>\n\tLike devils, rakshasas killed in the Nine Hells are forever destroyed.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Limited Magic Immunity</strong>: The rakshasa can't be affected or detected by spells of 6th level or lower unless it wishes to be. It has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The rakshasa's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). The rakshasa can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: <br><br>\n• At will: <em>detect thoughts, disguise self, mage hand, minor illusion</em><br>\n• 3/day each: <em>charm person, detect magic, invisibility, major image, suggestion</em><br>\n• 1/day each: <em>dominate person, fly, plane shift, true seeing</em><br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The rakshasa makes two claw attacks<br><br>\n\n<strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage, and the target is cursed if it is a creature. The magical curse takes effect whenever the target takes a short or long rest, filling the target's thoughts with horrible images and dreams. The cursed target gains no benefit from finishing a short or long rest. The curse lasts until it is lifted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">This private detective's business is unremarkable on the outside, its only distinguishing mark an orange-and-black sign featuring a cat's eyes.

If you want someone clubbed to death in their sleep, hire bugbears. If you want mean little fools, hire goblins.\"</em><br>\n—Stalman Klim, Slave Lord</blockquote><br>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26472040/hhzuQgK4bQ2u0KM8sviI7Q/med.jpg?1482176374\"></div>Picture: <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2IwNmNiMzk3ZWFh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Goblin</a><br><br>\n\n<h2>Goblins</h2>\nGoblins are small, black-hearted, selfish humanoids that lair in caves, abandoned mines, despoiled dungeons, and other dismal settings. Individually weak, goblins gather in large—sometimes overwhelming—numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tGoblinoids.</em></strong> Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, hobgoblins and bugbears, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMalicious Glee.</em></strong> Motivated by greed and malice, goblins can’t help but celebrate the few times they have the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer joy when victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace all manner of wickedness.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tLeaders and Followers.</em></strong> Goblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribe’s survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tChallenging Lairs.</em></strong> Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can’t navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tRat Keepers and Wolf Riders.</em></strong> Goblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWorshipers of Maglubiyet.</em></strong> Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet’s army on the plane of Acheron. This is a “privilege” that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One’s eternal tyranny even more than death.\n\n<br><br><blockquote>\n<em>\"Bree-Yark!\"</em><br>\n—Goblin for “We surrender!” (or so they say)</blockquote><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Nimble Escape</strong>: The goblin can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Scimitar</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Shortbow</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-2a1ebec3-fdca-6a7a-0d40-aac25818bdcb\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">If the characters talk loudly or otherwise make a lot of noise in area Q1, the <b>goblin </b>sentries in areas Q2a and Q2b awaken and shoot arrows at them through the arrow slits.

In recent months, Meloon has spent much of his time at the Yawning Portal.<br></span><br>Three months ago, out of boredom, Meloon accompanied a fledgling band of adventurers on an expedition to Undermountain. There, his luck ran out. While resting in the dungeon, the adventuring party was attacked by monsters unleashed by Xanathar—including a number of intellect devourers. One of the creatures succeeded in magically devouring and replacing Meloon's brain, turning the champion of Tymora into a puppet. After finishing off his unsuspecting companions, Meloon returned to Waterdeep as a Xanathar Guild spy.<br><br>The intellect devourer that inhabits Meloon's skull was bred by Nihiloor, a mind flayer in Xanathar's employ. It knows everything Meloon knew, and Meloon behaves much as he did before his descent into Undermountain. He hangs out at the Yawning Portal, tries to bond with adventurers, and offers a helping hand whenever doing so feels appropriate. The intellect devourer's primary goals are to steer adventurers away from Undermountain and get them to undertake quests that further the aims of Xanathar.

She also gets intelligence from many other sources, both through her own network of spies and from Harper agents.<br></span><br>Vajra runs Blackstaff Academy, a school for mages, out of Blackstaff Tower in the Castle Ward. She is also in charge of Force Grey, an order of highly skilled adventurers who are called upon to defend the city in times of need.

Grasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Interposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score.

This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere. Creatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere. Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.

While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target. When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment. Burial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb. Chaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal. Hedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade. Minimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby. Slumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs. Ending the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points. A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it. You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"minute","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"perm"},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":30,"long":"","units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":9,"school":"abj","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"A vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target","consumed":false,"cost":500,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":300000},{"_id":"YjI4NzAwYWY5ZjQ4","flags":{},"name":"Blackstaff (One-Handed)","type":"weapon","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/144_-_Vajra_Safahr/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><p><strong></strong><em>Melee Weapon Attack </em>+7, Reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit : </em>5 (1d6+2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) force damage.</p><p>Vajra can expend 1 of the staff’s charges to deal the force damage on a hit.</p></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":0,"attuned":false,"equipped":true,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":5,"long":"","units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"dex","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1d6+2","bludgeoning"],["1d6","force"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"weaponType":"natural","properties":{"amm":false,"hvy":false,"fin":false,"fir":false,"foc":false,"lgt":false,"rch":false,"rel":false,"ret":false,"spc":false,"thr":false,"two":false,"ver":false},"proficient":true},"sort":310000},{"_id":"NmIxNDRjZTk3NDlj","flags":{},"name":"Blackstaff (Two-Handed)","type":"weapon","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/144_-_Vajra_Safahr/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><p><strong></strong><em>Melee Weapon Attack </em>+7, Reach 5 . ft., one target. <em>Hit : </em>6 (1d8+2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) force damage.</p><p>Vajra can expend 1 of the staff’s charges to deal the force damage on a hit.</p></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":0,"attuned":false,"equipped":true,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":5,"long":"","units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"dex","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1d8+2","bludgeoning"],["1d6","force"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"weaponType":"natural","properties":{"amm":false,"hvy":false,"fin":false,"fir":false,"foc":false,"lgt":false,"rch":false,"rel":false,"ret":false,"spc":false,"thr":false,"two":false,"ver":false},"proficient":true},"sort":320000}]}

A ghoul haunts a place where it can gorge on dead flesh and decomposing organs. When it can’t feed on the dead, it pursues living creatures and attempts to make corpses of them. Though they gain no nourishment from the corpses they devour, ghouls are driven by an unending hunger that compels them to consume. A ghoul’s undead flesh never rots, and this monster can persist in a crypt or tomb for untold ages without feeding.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAbyssal Origins.</em></strong> Ghouls trace their origins to the Abyss. Doresain, the first of their kind, was an elf worshiper of Orcus. Turning against his own people, he feasted on humanoid flesh to honor the Demon Prince of Undeath. As a reward for his service, Orcus transformed Doresain into the first ghoul. Doresain served Orcus faithfully in the Abyss, creating ghouls from the demon lord’s other servants until an incursion by Yeenoghu, the demonic Gnoll Lord, robbed Doresain of his abyssal domain. When Orcus would not intervene on his behalf, Doresain turned to the elf gods for salvation, and they took pity on him and helped him escape certain destruction. Since then, elves have been immune to the ghouls’ paralytic touch.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tGhasts.</em></strong> Orcus sometimes infuses a ghoul with a stronger dose of abyssal energy, making a ghast. Whereas ghouls are little more than savage beasts, a ghast is cunning and can inspire a pack of ghouls to follow its commands.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Stench</strong>: Any creature that starts its turn within 5 ft. of the ghast must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the ghast's Stench for 24 hours.<br><br><strong>Turn Defiance</strong>: The ghast and any ghouls within 30 ft. of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit</em>: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Claws</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.

Their estate, Cassalanter Villa, has a temple of Asmodeus hidden underneath it.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span>The Cassalanters try to misdirect and discredit the characters rather than murder them. Victoro and Ammalia rely on their noble status to protect them, and the last thing they want is the City Watch on their doorstep.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span>If you choose the Cassalanters as the villains, the adventure takes place in the summer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Victoro and Ammalia Cassalanter struck a deal with Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells. Three years ago, they traded away the souls of their children to escape financial ruin. The soul of their eldest son, Osvaldo, was taken immediately. What was left behind was transformed into a chain devil, which the Cassalanters confined to their attic. Their two youngest children, Terenzio and Elzerina, are doomed to lose their souls when they turn nine years old a mere ten days after Founders' Day, a midsummer festival that celebrates Waterdeep's founding.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">After the deal was struck, the Cassalanters enjoyed a miraculous comeback. Their banking and money-lending business thrived while their competition suffered. The disappearance of their eldest son (and heir apparent) earned them sympathy. Their philanthropic endeavors bought them legitimacy and new friends. They became the envy of Waterdavian nobility in short order. Seemingly blessed, the Cassalanters attracted new followers to their cult of devil worship, which was Asmodeus's plan all along.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Reneging on a contract with Asmodeus is a luxury no mortal can afford, but there is a way for Lord and Lady Cassalanter to save the souls of Terenzio and Elzerina. A clause in the contract allows them to preserve their remaining (and future) children's lives by instead paying “one shy of a million gold coins, and the sacrifice of one shy of one hundred unfortunate souls.” The Cassalanters have most of the coin they need, but they require the gold from the Vault of Dragons to buy their children's salvation without bankrupting themselves.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-145af327-e3bb-a5f1-7e13-8ac52698cea3\"></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Victoro is in charge of locating the Vault of Dragons and securing the gold within it. Ammalia, for her part, plans to sacrifice ninety-nine souls in one fell swoop by throwing a feast on Founders' Day featuring poisoned food. Both the souls and the gold must be paid to Asmodeus at the same time. Foiling either one of these schemes spells doom for the Cassalanters' plot and their youngest children.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\"><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-8e53c03a-e3bc-1854-7daf-a2f58f5bff5f\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">Lady Cassalanter reacts with surprise to the sight of uninvited guests, but quickly conceals her feelings with a welcoming smile. She attempts to gain the intruders' confidence by pretending to believe that they are guests of Victoro's and saying that she simply was not told of their presence. With this pretense established, she tries to learn the characters' true intentions, casting charm person on the party using a 5th-level spell slot (affecting up to five creatures within 30 feet) if necessary. Using magic in this way is illegal, but Ammalia has a lot of goodwill banked in Waterdeep—enough to curry favor with a magistrate.</span></span><br></span></p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Evil","race":"","type":"humanoid (human)","environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"Roll 20","class":" 1"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"senses":"passive Perception 11","languages":{"value":["common","draconic","elvish","infernal"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":6,"passive":16},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"his":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":6,"passive":16},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"per":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":"4","max":4,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":"3","max":3,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":"3","max":3,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":"3","max":3,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":"1","max":1,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NTdhYjI5OGI4MzZm","sort":950000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/095_-_Ammalia_Cassalanter/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Ammalia Cassalanter","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/095_-_Ammalia_Cassalanter/token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":5,"brightSight":5,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"ZGJlMGU4MjUwODEw","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":45,"max":45},"bar2":{"value":12,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"NTZlMTBjNjM1ZDA4","flags":{},"name":"Spellcasting.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/095_-_Ammalia_Cassalanter/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Ammalia is a 9th-level spellcaster.

Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.<br><br><strong><em>Goblinoids.</em></strong> Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.<br><br><strong><em>Followers of Hruggek.</em></strong> Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek’s side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.<br><br><strong><em>Venal Ambushers.</em></strong> Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Brute</strong>: A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the bugbear hits with it (included in the attack).<br><br><strong>Surprise Attack</strong>: If the bugbear surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage from the attack.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Morningstar</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Melee)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Ranged)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\">Any member given an assignment from the Xanathar Guild might receive a monstrous bodyguard or assistant (such as a <b>bugbear</b>, a kenku, or a wererat), who has secret instructions to kill the guild member if they fail to complete the assignment as ordered.</p><hr><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\">On the first night of the 4th level Bregan D'aerthe, Xanathar sends a gang of six<b> bugbears</b> to attack the tavern and rescue Ott.

Few creatures spread fear, suspicion, and deceit better than doppelgangers. Found in every land and culture, they can take on the guise of any individual of any race.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tStealing Secrets.</em></strong> A doppelganger’s adopted form allows it to blend into almost any group or community, but its transformation doesn’t impart languages, mannerisms, memory, or personality. Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature’s surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature’s name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger impersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and close at hand for weeks, probing the victim’s mind daily to learn how to behave and speak authentically.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHedonistic Swindlers.</em></strong> Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con to con. While one doppelganger takes the place of a murdered merchant or noble, the others take on a number of identities as circumstances warrant, playing the parts of family or servants while they live off the victim’s riches.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tChangelings.</em></strong> Doppelgangers are too lazy or self-interested to raise their young. They assume attractive male forms and seduce women, leaving them to raise their progeny. A doppelganger child appears to be a normal member of its mother’s species until it reaches adolescence, at which point it discovers its true nature and is driven to seek out its kind to join them.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Traits</h2><strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br><strong>Ambusher</strong>: In the first round of a combat, the doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.<br><br><strong>Surprise Attack</strong>: If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Read Thoughts</strong>: The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p>Bonnie is the leader of a gang of five <b>doppelgangers </b>that arrived in Waterdeep over a year ago.

This benefit lasts until the end of the turn. If the priest expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.<br><br><strong>Spellcasting</strong>: The priest is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks).

The priest, as a bonus action, creates a floating, spectral weapon within 60 feet that lasts for one minute or until the priest casts this spell again. When the priest casts the spell, it can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon.

He leads a renegade drow faction called Bregan D'aerthe, made up of disenfranchised male drow, most of them culled from destroyed or disgraced houses. Gifted with a sharp mind, a sense of humor, puissant skill with a blade, and a wealth of useful magic items, Jarlaxle infiltrated the city of Luskan, brought a kind of order to its lawlessness, and declared himself its secret lord.<br></span><br>Jarlaxle likes to weave a tangled web of schemes that leave his enemies baffled—the latest of which is a plan to legitimize Luskan by making it a member of the Lords' Alliance. The city's unsavory reputation has thwarted all previous efforts, and the current leaders of the Lords' Alliance have voiced their opposition to Luskan's admittance. A few have flatly declared that the city will never be welcome in the alliance. Nonetheless, Jarlaxle aims to persuade Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, to champion Luskan's cause—even if that means losing other alliance members in the process. Tying Luskan's fortunes to those of Waterdeep would increase Jarlaxle's political and economic power on the Sword Coast.<br><br>Jarlaxle has come to Waterdeep in the guise of an Illuskan human named Zardoz Zord. “Captain Zord” is the master of the Sea Maidens Faire, a carnival that travels up and down the Sword Coast in three ships: the <i>Eyecatcher</i>, the <i>Heartbreaker</i>, and the <i>Hellraiser </i>(all words that describe Jarlaxle). He spends most of his time aboard the <i>Eyecatcher</i>, his personal ship. The other two vessels carry members of the carnival and their parade wagons.<br><br>Jarlaxle has forged an alliance with Lantan (an island to the south), and has armed his Bregan D'aerthe lieutenants with Lantanese firearms that rely on magical smokepowder to function. He has also acquired a Lantanese submarine called the Scarlet Marpenoth. This underwater vessel is mounted below the Eyecatcher and kept out of sight. Jarlaxle plans on using the submarine to flee Waterdeep if his scheme unravels.<br><br>Jarlaxle's loyalties are to himself first and foremost, and to Bregan D'aerthe secondarily.</p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Chaotic Neutral","race":"","type":"humanoid (elf)","environment":"","cr":15,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":13000},"source":"Roll 20","class":" 1"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 18","languages":{"value":["abyssal","common","draconic","dwarvish","elvish","undercommon"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":11,"passive":21},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"ath":{"value":1,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":6,"passive":16},"dec":{"value":2,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":14,"passive":24},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":8,"passive":18},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"slt":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":11,"passive":21},"ste":{"value":2,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":16,"passive":26},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":1,"max":1},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NTdhYjI5OGI4MzZm","sort":1160000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/116_-_Jarlaxle_Baenre/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Jarlaxle Baenre","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/116_-_Jarlaxle_Baenre/sides/*.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":125,"brightSight":120,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"ZTVkMzA3NzY2ZmMz","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":123,"max":123},"bar2":{"value":24,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":true},"items":[{"_id":"ODU4M2ViMDNlYTZh","flags":{},"name":"Special Equipment.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/116_-_Jarlaxle_Baenre/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p> Jarlaxle wears +3 leather armor, a hat of disguise, a bracer of flying daggers, a cloak of invisibility, a knave's eye patch, and a ring of truth telling.

Although treants prefer to while away the days, months, and years in quiet contemplation, they fiercely protect their woodland demesnes from outside threats.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tThe Sleeping Tree Awakens.</em></strong> A tree destined to become a treant meditates through a long cycle of seasons, living normally for decades or centuries before realizing its potential. Trees that awaken do so only under special circumstances and in places steeped with nature’s magic. Treants and powerful druids can sense when a tree has the spark of potential, and they protect such trees in secret groves as they draw near the moment of their awakening. During the long process of awakening, a tree acquires face-like features in its bark, a division of the lower trunk into legs, and long branches bending downward to serve as its arms. When it is ready, the tree pulls its legs free from the clutching earth and joins its fellows in protecting its woodland home.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tLegendary Guardians.</em></strong> After a treant awakens, it continues to grow exactly as it did when it was a tree. Treants created from the mightiest trees can reach great sizes while developing an innate magical power over plants and animals. Such treants can animate plants, using them to ensnare and trap intruders. They can call wild creatures to aid them or carry messages across great distances.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tProtectors of the Wild.</em></strong> Even after awakening, a treant spends much of its time living as a tree. While rooted in place, a treant remains aware of its surroundings, and can perceive the effects of events taking place miles away based on subtle changes nearby.<br><br>\n\tWoodcutters who avoid culling healthy living trees and hunters who take only what they need of the forest’s bounty are unlikely to arouse a treant’s ire. Creatures careless with fire, those who poison the forest, and those who destroy great trees, especially a tree close to awakening, face the treant’s wrath.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>False Appearance</strong>: While the treant remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Siege Monster</strong>: The treant deals double damage to objects and structures.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The treant makes two slam attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Rock</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Animate Trees (1/Day)</strong>: The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38 ; margin-top: 0pt ; margin-bottom: 0pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">If someone other than a Brandath descendant tries to open the mausoleum, the<b> treant</b> animates two nearby trees and then attacks.

If they ask Renaer to admit them to the Brandath family mausoleum, he agrees to do so. Because the treant can sense that Renaer has Brandath blood in his veins, it allows him and those he calls his friends to enter unmolested, and says to Renaer in passing, “Your mother was a lovely

They reached out with their minds and seized control of the burgeoning life-forms of the mortal realm, making those creatures their slaves. Their dominance made them like gods. Then the true gods appeared, smashing the aboleths’ empire and freeing their slaves.<br><br>Aboleths have never forgotten.<br><br><strong><em>Eternal Memories.</em></strong> Aboleths have flawless memories. They pass on their knowledge and experience from generation to generation. Thus, the injury of their defeat by the gods remains perfectly preserved in their minds.<br><br>Aboleths’ minds are treasure troves of ancient lore, recalling moments from prehistory with perfect clarity. They plot patiently and intricately across eons. Few creatures can conceive of the extent of an aboleth’s plan.<br><br><strong><em>Gods in the Lake.</em></strong> Aboleths dwell in watery environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the Elemental Plane of Water. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them, aboleths are like gods, demanding worship and obedience from their subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge and experiences of their prey to their eternal memories.<br><br>Aboleths use their telepathic powers to read the minds of creatures and know their desires. An aboleth uses this knowledge to gain a creature’s loyalty, promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for obedience. Within its lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses, granting creatures, such as its followers, the illusion of promised rewards.<br><br><strong><em>Enemies of the Gods.</em></strong> The aboleths’ fall from power is written in stark clarity on their flawless memories, for aboleths never truly die. If an aboleth’s body is destroyed, its spirit returns to the Elemental Plane of Water, where a new body coalesces for it over days or months.<br><br>Ultimately, aboleths dream of overthrowing the gods and regaining control of the world. Aboleths have had untold eons to plot and to prepare their plans for perfect execution.<br><br><h2>An Aboleth’s Lair</h2>Aboleths lair in subterranean lakes or the rocky depths of the ocean, often surrounded by the ruins of an ancient, fallen aboleth city. An aboleth spends most of its existence underwater, surfacing occasionally to treat with visitors or deranged worshipers.<br><br><h3>Lair Actions</h3>When fighting inside its lair, an aboleth can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the aboleth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:<br><br><ul>\n<li>The aboleth casts <em>phantasmal force</em> (no components required) on any number of creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. While maintaining concentration on this effect, the aboleth can’t take other lair actions. If a target succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the aboleth’s phantasmal force lair action for the next 24 hours, although such a creature can choose to be affected.</li>\n<li>Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone. The aboleth can’t use this lair action again until it has used a different one.</li>\n<li>Water in the aboleth’s lair magically becomes a conduit for the creature’s rage. The aboleth can target any number of creatures it can see in such water within 90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. The aboleth can’t use this lair action again until it has used a different one.</li>\n</ul><br><h3>Regional Effects</h3>The region containing an aboleth’s lair is warped by the creature’s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:<br><br><ul>\n<li>Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth’s lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain.</li>\n<li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the aboleth that drink such water vomit it within minutes.</li>\n<li>As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image of itself within 1 mile of the lair. The copy can appear at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature charmed by the aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image’s position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears.</li>\n</ul><br>If the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the course of 3d10 days.<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/25769065/yYGFYGoJpYR5nhdXWMH9Jw/med.png?1480459427\"></div><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Amphibious</strong>: The aboleth can breathe air and water.<br><br><strong>Mucous Cloud</strong>: While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 ft. of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.<br><br><strong>Probing Telepathy</strong>: If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.<br><br><strong>Tentacle</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6, 1d12, acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.<br><br><strong>Tail</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Enslave (3/day)</strong>: The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.<br><br>Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.<br><br><h2>Legendary Actions</h2>Can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Spent legendary actions are regained at the start of each turn.<br><br><strong>Detect</strong>: The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br><strong>Tail Swipe</strong>: The aboleth makes one tail attack.<br><br><strong>Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions)</strong>: One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-5d991c66-fcb8-0695-213f-6db5390e1d40\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">While in stone form, the <b>aboleth</b> isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. <i>The Stone of Golorr </i>is immune to all damage.

The timing is unfortunate for him, since he was planning to earn a small fortune by turning over the Stone of Go­lorr to his Luskanite contact.

In either case, she insists on trying something before letting him off the hook: after taking a short rest, she has Fenerus brought to her courtroom and questions him about the stone. Surreptitiously, she uses her detect thoughts spell to scan his surface thoughts in an attempt to discern the stone's location. Given that the stone is foremost in Fenerus's mind, Magistrate Barch learns where it is hidden, shares the information with the characters, and returns Fenerus to his cell.</p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Non-lawful Alignment","race":"","type":"humanoid (any race)","environment":"","cr":2,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":450},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"senses":"passive Perception 10","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ath":{"value":1,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"NmU5YzIxZWRkN2Yx","sort":250000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/025_-_Bandit_Captain/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Bandit Captain","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/025_-_Bandit_Captain/token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":5,"brightSight":5,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"ZjE2MDM2ZDZlOGQz","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":65,"max":65},"bar2":{"value":15,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"ZDk3YzZlNTA0MDMw","flags":{},"name":"Parry.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/dragon-heist/characters/025_-_Bandit_Captain/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it.

A gargoyle lurks among masonry and ruins, as still as any stone sculpture, and delights in the terror it creates when it breaks from its suspended pose, as well as the pain it inflicts on its victims.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAnimate Stone.</em></strong> Gargoyles cling to rocky cliffs and mountains, or roost on ledges in underground caves. They haunt city rooftops, perching vulture-like among the high stone arches and buttresses of castles and cathedrals, and they can hold themselves so still that they appear inanimate. Able to maintain this state for years, a gargoyle makes an ideal sentry.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDeadly Reputation.</em></strong> Gargoyles have a reputation for cruelty. Statues carved into the likenesses of gargoyles appear in the architecture of countless cultures to frighten away trespassers. Although such sculptures are only decorative, real gargoyles can hide among them to ambush unsuspecting victims. A gargoyle might alleviate the tedium of its watch by catching and tormenting birds or rodents, but its long wait only increases its craving for harming sentient creatures.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCruel Servants.</em></strong> Gargoyles are easily inspired by the cunning of an intelligent master. They enjoy simple tasks such as guarding a master’s home, torturing and killing interlopers, and anything else that involves minimum effort and maximum pain and carnage.<br><br>\n\tGargoyles sometimes serve demons for their propensity for wanton chaos and destruction. Powerful spellcasters can also easily enlist gargoyle guardians to keep watch over their gates and walls. Gargoyles have the patience and fortitude of stone, and will serve even the cruelest master for years without complaint.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tElemental Nature.</em></strong> A gargoyle doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Shards of Elemental Evil</h2>\nAs Ogrémoch, the evil Prince of Elemental Earth, treads his stony realm, it leaves shards of broken rock in his wake. Imbued with slivers of sentience, these shards thrum with the essence of the elemental prince, growing over long years into vaguely humanoid rock formations that resolve at last into the hard, cruel shapes of gargoyles.<br><br>\n\tOgrémoch doesn’t create gargoyles deliberately, but they are a physical manifestation of his evil. Gargoyles are mockeries of the elemental air that Ogrémoch despises. They are heavy creatures of living stone, yet capable of flight.
