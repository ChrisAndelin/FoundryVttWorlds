Lord has abaondoned (or died) his responsibilities for his region. Orcs have taken over his castle. Eldham Village no longer has leadership. Raided too many times by bandits &amp; goblins. Nearby castle owned by a lord is now overrun by orcs. The guard (known as The Steel Blades or Silent Blades) has turned to banditry. </p>\n<p>Captain Corgan is located on other side of the region in the town of Tarrin. </p>\n<p>Holsworthy Village: Long ago destroyed.
