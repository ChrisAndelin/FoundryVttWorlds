A relatively unskilled alchemist could make a weak healing potion (3 CP) from basic materials by just spending 3 days at work. Alternately, a similarly unskilled alchemist with access to several different healing herbs (3) could make a weak healing potion relatively quickly, using up the herbs in the process. Finally, a skilled alchemist (level 3 alchemy skill) could make weak healing potions all day with only limited time or materials spent. Since you are at level 1, you could make weak healing potions with two ingredients or only require 2 days to make them. Or you could use extra time and ingredients to add more CP and enhance the effects.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"SJgpix6pxi5ec5xa":3},"flags":{}}
