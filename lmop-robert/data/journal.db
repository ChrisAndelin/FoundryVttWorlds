While he doesn't often offer quests himself, he often knows others who are. Since many adventurers have graced his tavern over the years, he might also be a good resource to gain information about locations and monsters within the Marsh.</p>\n<p>Refusing to leave the location where she was sent, <strong>Ma Grim</strong> has quickly become a feature of the tavern. She runs the tables and serving staff ruthlessly but it becomes an open secret that she saves nearly all of her wages to help out the other employees, buying medicine for sick kids or offering a little bit of cash here and there to help the others make ends meet. Ma Grim has out her Advisor skills to work and is constantly looking to understand the deeper \"rules\" of the Marsh to help out her charges. She lacks the background knowledge to help directly with quests but she should probably be your first contact whenever you get stuck on the mechanics.</p>\n<p>Several others patronize the Brews including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\n<ul>\n<li>Ardent, an Eladrin spellcaster of some kind.</li>\n<li>Arvam, a young orphan who fled violence out in the Marsh.</li>\n<li>Bro'gall, a powerful goliath warrior covered in runic tattoos.</li>\n<li>Felya Lightfoot, a human woman who is always accompanied by a glowing orb.</li>\n<li>Thorram the Builder, a dwarven architect looking for some help.</li>\n<li>Zum-Zith, an older gnome craftswoman specializing in fine linens.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Â </p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>Secret:</p>\n<p>Ardent and Bro'gall are both members of the Salmaat Qaqqadi, a faction focused on increasing their individual strength. Ardent is always looking for Arcane Treasures (gold tier and above) to use for his own advancement and will trade lesser Treasures and support players looking for racial evolutions in return. Bro'gall leads a mercenary band and will hire players for miscellaneous jobs. He is specifially looking for a Might Core, a Ritual Spirit, and a Blade Spririt for his own advancement. He'll approach players with information about how to find cores and spirits in return for an oath to bring him the cores and spirits he is looking for.</p>\n<p>Felya Lightfoot is a member of the Gilded Way faction and will be interested in the players once they start having some coin to throw around. She'll always have a few powerful magical items to sell, ocassionally including cores or spirits, and she'll challenge players to break into the Vault, although she may invite them on some simpler heists first. She is the part of the Crane who is most interested in what is happening outside of Fenrir and she may eventually hire players to deal with threats to the city if she believes she can trust them.</p>\n</section>","folder":"noCfEyHFUS9fncji","sort":0,"permission":{"default":1,"3NRBPk2mFqZEHybd":3,"Xc6IxhIt83r1NcBy":2},"flags":{}}
