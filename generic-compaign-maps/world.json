  "description": "<p>Welcome to the Marsh!</p>\n<p>Nestled inside of the large kingdom of Varous is a massive swamp known officially as the Marsh of Daveltonas, but called simply the Marsh by most. While the land is officially claimed by the Harus dynasty, their actual ability to police the area is limited. Instead, the Marsh is divided into sections ruled over by whatever creature or power can hold their own. Dragons, liches, yuan-ti, lizardfolk, trolls, and more have all carved out their own territories while small towns and farms struggle to survive the violent politics of the region. The swamp contains some of the last ruins of the Wruviel Empire which once dominated the majority of the three continents of Troj and as civilization has rebuilt following the fall of the empire, greedy eyes now turn to the untapped treasures within the Marsh.</p>\n<p>Â </p>",
