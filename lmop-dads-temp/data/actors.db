They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.<br><br>Elves can live over 700 years. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance, and they trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence.<br><br>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals, which they have no interest in mining.<br><br>In the Forgotten Realms, your people are named sun elves. Also called gold elves or sunrise elves, sun elves have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond, and their eyes are golden, silver, or black. They are more reclusive than the other branch of high elves, the moon elves, but Oghma has called you to live among other peoples, rather than in the sanctuaries of your kin.<hr>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, sometime after the hundredth birthday. Before this period, they are called by child names. On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name. Every elf also bears a family name, typically a combination of Elvish words. Some elves traveling among other races translate their family names into Common.<br><br><strong>Child Names:</strong> Ara, Bryn, Del, Innil, Lael, Mella, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Syllin, Vall<br><br><strong>Male Adult Names:</strong> Adran, Berrian, Carric, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Immeral, Paelias, Quarion, Riardon, Soveliss, Theren, Varis<br><br><strong>Female Adult Names:</strong> Althaea, Bethrynna, Caelynn, Ielenia, Leshanna, Meriele, Naivara, Quillathe, Silaqui, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia<br><br><strong>Family Names (Common Translations):</strong> Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom)<hr><h2>Wizard</h2>Wizards are supreme magic-users. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, they cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. The mightiest wizards learn to conjure elementals from other planes of existence, glimpse the future, or turn slain foes into zombies.<hr><h2>Background</h2>You have spent your life dedicated to Oghma, all-seeing god of knowledge, and spent years learning the lore of the multiverse.<br><br><strong><em>Personal Goal: Reconsecrate the Defiled Altar.</em></strong> Through visions delivered in your trances, your god has called you to a new mission. A goblin tribe has made its lair in an ancient ruin now called Cragmaw Castle, where they have defiled a shrine once sacred to Oghma. Now dedicated to the vile goblin god Maglubiyet, the altar is an offense to Oghma that must not stand.<br><br>You’re sure Oghma has greater things in store for you if you can complete this quest. In the meantime, your visions suggest that Sister Garaele—a priest of Tymora, the goddess of luck—can aid you in the town of Phandalin.<br><br><strong><em>Alignment: Chaotic Good.</em></strong> The pursuit and acquisition of knowledge is for the benefit of all. Kingdoms and laws are useful so far as they allow knowledge to flourish. Tyrants who seek to suppress and control it are the worst villains. You share your knowledge freely, and use what you have learned to help where you can.<hr><h2>Gaining Levels</h2>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.<br><br>With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d6 + 2 to your hit point maximum.<br><br>You gain access to more spells as you gain levels. You can prepare a number of spells equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier, as shown in the Spellcasting Advancement table. You also gain more spell slots.<br><strong><br>Spellcasting Advancement</strong><br><div style=\"margin-left: 160px\">—Spell Slots per Spell Level—</div><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Level</strong></td><td><strong>Prepared Spells</strong></td><td><strong>1st</strong></td><td><strong>2nd</strong></td><td><strong>3rd</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table><br><h4>Adding to Your Spellbook</h4>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook, chosen from the wizard spell list in the rulebook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. On your adventures, you might also find scrolls or books containing other spells you can add to your spellbook.<br><br><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.<br><br>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and requires 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.<br><br><h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4><strong><em>Evocation Savant.</em></strong> The gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.<br><br><em><strong>Sculpt Spells.</strong></em> When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage from it.<br><br><h4>3rd Level: 900 XP</h4><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> You can now prepare and cast 2nd-level spells.<br><br><h4>4th Level: 2,700 XP</h4><strong><em>Spells</em></strong>. You learn one more wizard cantrip of your choice.<br><strong><em>Ability Score Improvement.</em></strong> Your Intelligence increases to 18, which has the following effects:<br>• Your Intelligence modifier becomes +4.<br>• Your spell saving throw DC increases by 1.<br>• Your bonus for your spell attacks increases by 1.<br>• Your modifier to Intelligence saving throws increases by 1.<br>• Your modifier to Intelligence-based skills increases by 1.<br><br><h4>5th Level: 6,500 XP</h4><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> You can prepare and cast 3rd-level spells.<br><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:<br>• Your attack bonus increases by 1 for your spell attacks and weapons you’re proficient with.<br>• Your spell saving throw DC increases by 1.<br>• Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in (indicated by a checkmark) increases by 1.<br>• Because the modifier for your Perception skill increased, your passive Wisdom (Perception) score increases by 1.<br>\n<hr><section><p><strong>Personality Traits :</strong> </p><p>I use polysyllabic words that convey  the impression of erudition.

You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.&nbsp;For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance.

A form lurches into view, dragging one foot as it raises bloated arms and broken hands. The zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too slow to escape its grasp.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDark Servants.</em></strong> Sinister necromantic magic infuses the remains of the dead, causing them to rise as zombies that do their creator’s bidding without fear or hesitation. They move with a jerky, uneven gait, clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest, and carrying the stench of decay.<br><br>\n\tMost zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can’t be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell.<br><br>\n\tA zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHideous Forms.</em></strong> Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMindless Soldiers.</em></strong> Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.<br><br>\n\tA zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won’t retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUndead Nature.</em></strong> A zombie doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Undead Fortitude</strong>: If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit.

Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an old dirt road.<br><br>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation.<br><br>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship, as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity.<hr>A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family names are often nicknames that stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through the generations.<br><br><strong>Male Names:</strong> Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich, Finnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn, Perrin, Reed, Roscoe, Wellby<br><br><strong>Female Names: </strong>Andry, Bree, Callie, Cora, Euphemia, Jillian, Kithri, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Nedda, Paela, Portia, Seraphina, Shaena, Trym, Vani, Verna<br><br><strong>Family Names:</strong> Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle, High-hill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage, Tosscobble, Underbough<hr><h3>Rogue</h3>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem.<hr><h3>Background</h3>The town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of an older settlement, vacant for five centuries until some hardy settlers set about rebuilding it some years back. Drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the nearby foothills, you came to Phandalin as well, not to earn a living, but to prey on those who struck it rich. You joined a gang calling itself the Redbrands and made some decent coin as a burglar, enforcer, or fence.<br><br>But you must have made an enemy among your fellow Redbrands. Someone set you up. On that person’s word, the head of the Redbrands—a wizard called Glasstaff—tried to have you killed. You escaped, barely alive and thanking Tymora, the goddess of good fortune, for your luck. You fled Phandalin, almost penniless and with only the tools of your trade to your name.<br><br><em><strong>Personal Goal:</strong></em> Get Your Revenge. Someone in the Redbrands nearly got you killed, and you sure would like to know who it was. And then you’d like to take your revenge—on that person, on Glasstaff, maybe on all the Redbrands. And you just got a tip that might help you: someone named Halia Thornton also has it out for the Redbrands. She lives in Phandalin, which means showing your face to the Redbrands who still want you dead.<br><br><em><strong>Alignment: Neutral.</strong></em> You tend to do whatever seems best at the time. Sure, you’ve done some things you’re not proud of, and you’re not personally committed to making the world a better place. But you have no interest in causing suffering or making things worse than they already are.<hr><h3>Gaining Levels</h3>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.<br><br>With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d8 + 1 to your hit point maximum.<br><br><h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4><strong><em>Cunning Action.</em></strong> Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly, so you can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.<br><br><h4>3rd Level: 900 XP</h4><strong><em>Second-Story Work.</em></strong> You gain the ability to climb faster than normal, so climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.<br><br><strong><em>Fast Hands.</em></strong> You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, take the Use an Object action, or use your thieves’ tools to try to disarm a trap or open a lock.<br><br><strong><em>Sneak Attack.</em></strong> You deal 2d6 damage with your Sneak Attack feature, instead of 1d6.<br><br><h4>4th Level: 2,700 XP</h4><strong><em>Ability Score Improvement.</em></strong> Your Dexterity increases to 18, which has the following effects:<br><ul><li>Your Dexterity modifier becomes +4.</li><li>Your attack bonus and your damage for Dexterity-based attacks, such as your shortsword and shortbow, increase by 1.</li><li>Your modifier to Dexterity saving throws increases by 1.</li><li>Your modifier to Dexterity-based skills increases by 1.</li><li>While you wear light or no armor, your Armor Class increases by 1.</li><li>Your initiative increases by 1.</li></ul><br><h4>5th Level: 6,500 XP</h4><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:<br><ul><li>Your attack bonus increases by 1 for weapons you’re proficient with.</li><li>Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in (indicated by a checkmark) increases by 1. Your Expertise feature means your bonus for Stealth and the use of thieves’ tools instead each increase by 2.</li></ul><strong><em>Sneak Attack.</em></strong> You deal 3d6 damage with your Sneak Attack feature, instead of 2d6.<br><br><strong><em>Uncanny Dodge.</em></strong> When an attacker you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.<br><br><h4>Improving Your Armor</h4>As you acquire treasure, you can buy better armor to improve your Armor Class.

Drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the nearby foothills, you came to Phandalin as well, not to earn a living, but to prey on those who struck it rich. You joined a gang calling itself the Redbrands and made some decent coin as a burglar, enforcer, or fence.</p><p>   But you must have made an enemy among your fellow Redbrands. Someone set you up. On that person’s word, the head of the Redbrands—a wizard called Glasstaff—tried to have you killed. You escaped, barely alive and thanking Tymora, the goddess of good fortune, for your luck. You fled Phandalin, almost penniless and with only the tools of your trade to your name.</p><p></p><p>Personal Goal: Get Your Revenge. Someone in the Redbrands nearly got you killed, and you sure would like to know who it was. And then you’d like to take your revenge—on that person, on Glasstaff, maybe on all the Redbrands. And you just got a tip that might help you: someone named Halia Thornton also has it out for the Redbrands. She lives in Phandalin, which means showing your face to the Redbrands who still want you dead.</p><p></p><p>Alignment: Neutral. You tend to do whatever seems best at the time. Sure, you’ve done some things you’re not proud of, and you’re not personally committed to making the world a better place. But you have no interest in causing suffering or making things worse than they already are.</p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral","race":"","background":"Criminal","originalClass":"","xp":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":300,"pct":0},"appearance":"","trait":"I never have a plan, but I’m great at making things up as I go along.

Unfortunately, the Rockseekers did not realize they were being trailed by spies working for Nezznar, the Black Spider, and they inadvertently led the drow villain to their prize. Nezznar and his followers dealt with the two Rockseekers who were guarding their find, then arranged for Gundren’s ambush. Learning of the adventurers’ involvement with Gundren or their exploits in and around Phandalin, the Black Spider has given orders for the characters to be dealt with.

Given the chance, he quizzes the characters at length regarding their identities, allegiances, interests, and goals,. He files it all away in memory in the hope that someday he might find a use for what he learns.<br><br>Nezznar admits to being the Black Spider, and to using the Cragmaw goblins and the Redbrands to ensure that Wave Echo Cave remains his secret. He will say or do anything to put the characters off their guard, including promising to surrender or proposing cooperation against the monsters impeding his progress toward reaching the Forge of Spells.

Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.<br><br>The half eld is a member of the <em>Order of the Gauntlet</em>, a devout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though he is no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on happenings around Phandalin. He is happy to trade news with fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to hold to these virtues.<br><br>He is concerned about the Redbrands, and he would like to see a group of adventurers teach the ruffians a lesson. He tells the characters that it’s time someone took a stand against the Redbrands’ leader, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGIyNzIxMjBhMWJh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Glasstaff</a>. Daran knows the Redbrands hang around the Sleeping Giant tap house, but he can also tell the characters that the main Redbrand safe house lies under Tresendar Manor, the ruin at the east edge of town. (See the “Redbrand Hideout” section in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2FjNDQ1Mjk4ZWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Act 2: Phandalin</a> for more information.)<br><br><strong><em>Quest - Old Owl Trouble:</em></strong> Daran has heard stories from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that someone is digging around in the ruins known as Old Owl Well. More disturbingly, several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks the characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeast of Phandalin, and find out who’s there and what they’re up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there.

He speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the order, such as honor and vigilance.

But they are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the world, the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.<br><br>When humans settle somewhere, they stay. They build cities to last for the ages and great kingdoms that can persist for centuries. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.<br><br>Human culture varies by region. In the Forgotten Realms, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature in the northwestern lands of Neverwinter are different from their counterparts in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east. Human physical characteristics vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of Neverwinter have every possible variation of coloration and features.<hr>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans have no truly typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly). Traditional names among different human cultures vary widely. You might be Haseid (Calishite), Kerri (Chondathan), Kosef (Damaran), Amafrey (Illuskan), So-Kehur (Mulan), Madislak (Rashemi), Mei (Shou), or Salazar (Turami).<hr><h3>Fighter</h3>Fighters are the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.<hr><h3>Background</h3>Your family is no stranger to wealth, power, and privilege. In the glory days of Neverwinter, your parents were the count and countess of Corlinn Hill, a large estate located in the hills northeast of the city. But Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, devastating Neverwinter and erasing Corlinn Hill from the map. Instead of growing up on an estate, you were raised in a small but comfortable town house in Waterdeep. As an adult, you stand to inherit a meaningless title and little else.<br><strong><em><br>Personal Goal: Civilize Phandalin.</em></strong> You were meant for more than being a ruler of nothing at all. Rebuilding Corlinn Hill is impractical, thanks to the volcano. But in the last three or four years, hardy settlers have been rebuilding another ruin near the city: the old town of Phandalin, which orcs sacked five centuries ago. Clearly, what Phandalin needs now is a civilizing influence—someone to take the reins and bring law and order. Someone like you.<br><br>You’re not the only one with such ideas. A knight named Sildar Hallwinter recently set out for Phandalin in the company of a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker. They plan to reclaim an ancient mine and restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity. Since your goals align, Hallwinter should be willing to assist you.<br><br><strong><em>Alignment: Lawful Neutral.</em></strong> It’s essential to establish law and order, even if it takes an iron fist to do it. The nobility are bound by honor and tradition to protect their people from both external and internal threats to stability. An organized society leaves no room for evil and chaos to take root.<br><hr><h2>Gaining Levels</h2>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.<br>With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d10 + 2 to your hit point maximum.<br><br><h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4><em><strong>Action Surge.</strong></em> You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment.

As an adult, you stand to inherit a meaningless title and little else.</p><p></p><p>Personal Goal: Civilize Phandalin. You were meant for more than being a ruler of nothing at all. Rebuilding Corlinn Hill is impractical, thanks to the volcano. But in the last three or four years, hardy settlers have been rebuilding another ruin near the city: the old town of Phandalin, which orcs sacked five centuries ago. Clearly, what Phandalin needs now is a civilizing influence—someone to take the reins and bring law and order. Someone like you.</p><p>   You’re not the only one with such ideas. A knight named Sildar Hallwinter recently set out for Phandalin in the company of a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker. They plan to reclaim an ancient mine and restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity. Since your goals align, Hallwinter should be willing to assist you.</p><p></p><p>Alignment: Lawful Neutral. It’s essential to establish law and order, even if it takes an iron fist to do it. The nobility are bound by honor and tradition to protect their people from both external and internal threats to stability. An organized society leaves no room for evil and chaos to take root.</p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Neutral","race":"","background":"Noble","originalClass":"","xp":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":300,"pct":0},"appearance":"","trait":"My flattery makes those I talk to feel wonderful and important.

Though he receives very few visitors, he is reasonably hospitable.<br><br>Reidoth is adept at staying away from the ash zombies that overrun the village, as well as avoiding the area’s mutated plants. He knows that dangerous spiders lurk in the ruins at the base of the hill, and he suspects that someone is hiding out on the eastern side of town—he’s seen “folk in black masks and cloaks” (the cultists) skulking around. However, he is currently most concerned by the fact that a green dragon has moved into the tower (Area 7 of The Ruins of Thundertree) since the last time he was here. He warns the characters of all these threats, and suggests that they leave Thundertree before they get themselves killed.<br><br><h4>Developments</h4>If the characters ask about Cragmaw Castle, Reidoth gladly provides directions. He is a member of the <em>Emerald Enclave</em>, a widespread group of wilderness survivalists who preserve the natural order while rooting out troublesome threats. The enclave works to restore and preserve the natural order by keeping the elemental forces of the world in check, preventing civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another, and helping others survive the perils of the wilds. The goblins are a threat to the delicate balance.<br><br>If the characters ask Reidoth about Wave Echo Cave, he will not divulge its location but will offer to guide the party there in exchange for a favor: he wants them to chase off the dragon in area 7. If they succeed, Reidoth will honor his part of the agreement but will not accompany the party inside the mine.<br><br>If the characters attack him for any reason, Reidoth transforms into a gray squirrel and scurries out of the cottage through a crack in the wall. He vanishes into the woods, then waits for the hostile characters to leave. His watch post contains nothing of value.<br><br><h4>Joining the Emerald Enclave</h4>If the party helps Reidoth by chasing off Venomfang, the druid privately approaches certain members of the group and urges them to join the <em>Emerald Enclave</em>. He speaks with those who exemplify the ideal of protecting the natural order. If a character agrees, Reidoth gives the individual the title of <em>Springwarden</em>.</section>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Good","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"Human","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":2,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":450},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"med":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"nat":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonus":1,"mod":3,"passive":13},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""},"bonuses":{"mwak":"","rwak":"","msak":"","rsak":"","damage":"","abilityCheck":"","abilitySave":"","skillCheck":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Reidoth","displayName":50,"img":"modules/lmop-shared/characters/044_-_Reidoth_the_Druid/token.png","tint":null,"width":0.5,"height":0.5,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":1000,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"NTk5NDg0YTg3ZWYw","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"ZDVhYjYyODU4ZWQx","name":"Spellcasting.","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The druid is a 4th-level spellcaster.

He is a loyal member of the <em>Lords’ Alliance</em>, a political organization that unites the various free cities and towns of the North. He accompanied Gundren back to Phandalin, because he had his own business in town. As an agent of the <em>Lords’ Alliance</em>, his goal is to bring law and order to Phandalin. He also wishes to locate a previous <em>Lords' Alliance</em> member that has gone missing.<br><br>In <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTQwODFiYzMyYTAx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Overview of Act 1</a>, Sildar is a captive in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWFkNzg1ZjA3ZGQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Cragmaw Hideout</a>. All of his gear has been taken from him and sent off to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTA3ZWUyOWMxYTlm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Cragmaw Castle</a> along with Gundren. If the party is able to rescue him, he can become a travel companion and quest giver later on in the adventure.<br><br>In <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2FjNDQ1Mjk4ZWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Overview of Act 2</a>, Sildar settles in and begins work at establishing order at Townmaster’s Hall (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmFmYTU3NWY3YjJj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Phandalin Locations</a>). He offers two quests to the party:<br><br><strong>1.

Find Iarno Albrek.</strong> After questioning several locals, Sildar learns that Iarno Albrek, a fellow member of the <em>Lords’ Alliance</em>, disappeared while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor about two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar asks the characters to investigate the manor and the surrounding area to find and bring back Iarno—or what’s left of him, if something killed him.<br><br><h4>Joining the Lords’ Alliance</h4>If the party eliminates the goblin threat from Cragmaw Castle or uncovers Iarno’s treachery, Sildar Hallwinter privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the <em>Lords’ Alliance</em>. He speaks with those who exemplify a desire for the security of civilization through action. If a character agrees, Sildar Hallwinter awards the individual the title of <em>Cloak</em>.</section>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral

Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don’t cross her.<div><br>If the party ask for information to help find Gundren Rockseeker, Halia doesn’t know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but she has heard that the Redbrands have a goblin minion serving them. She suggests the goblin might know the location. She leverages this information to try to persuade the characters into helping her deal with the Redbrands.<br></div><br><strong><em>Quest - Halia’s Job Offer:</em></strong> If approached by characters she believes she can control, Halia explains that the Redbrands are a problem. She tells how the ruffians loiter around the Sleeping Giant tap house and have a base under Tresendar Manor, on the east edge of town. She then offers the characters 100 gp to eliminate the Redbrand leader, whom the outlaws call <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGIyNzIxMjBhMWJh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Glasstaff</a>, and bring her any correspondence found in the leader’s quarters. Halia doesn’t reveal that she wants to take over the Redbrand operation herself. A DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check indicates she has ulterior motives for wanting the Redbrand leader dead.<br><br><h4>Joining the Zhentarim</h4>If the party disposes of the Redbrand leader, Halia Thornton approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the <em>Zhentarim</em>.

But they are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the world, the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.<br /><br />When humans settle somewhere, they stay. They build cities to last for the ages and great kingdoms that can persist for centuries. They live fully in the present&mdash;making them well suited to the adventuring life&mdash;but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.<br /><br />Human culture varies by region. In the Forgotten Realms, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature in the northwestern lands of Neverwinter are different from their counterparts in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east. Human physical characteristics vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of Neverwinter have every possible variation of coloration and features.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans have no truly typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly). Traditional names among different human cultures vary widely. You might be Haseid (Calishite), Kerri (Chondathan), Kosef (Damaran), Amafrey (Illuskan), So-Kehur (Mulan), Madislak (Rashemi), Mei (Shou), or Salazar (Turami).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Fighter</h3>\n<p>Fighters are the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings&mdash;as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Your parents lived in the prosperous village of Thundertree, east of the city of Neverwinter and at the edge of the Neverwinter Wood. But when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, your parents fled, carrying you in your infancy. Your family drifted from village to village around the region, finding work as servants or laborers where they could.<br /><br />You&rsquo;ve spent the last few years in Neverwinter as a porter and laborer at the city&rsquo;s bustling docks. But it&rsquo;s clear to you and everyone around you that you are destined for much more. You stood up to an abusive ship captain once, so other dockworkers look up to you. Someday, you&rsquo;ll come into your own. You&rsquo;ll be a hero.<br /><br /><strong><em>Personal Goal: Drive Off the Dragon.</em></strong> The ruins of Thundertree call to you. Your family and their friends once lived in prosperity there, and now they&rsquo;re reduced to menial labor. The ruins are haunted by ash zombies, and rumor has it a dragon has made its lair in the Old Tower, but those are problems a hero can solve. Slay the dragon, or drive it off, and you&rsquo;ll prove&mdash;to yourself and everyone else&mdash;you&rsquo;re a real hero, destined for greatness.<br /><br /><strong><em>Alignment: Lawful Good.</em></strong> A hero stands up to evil and never lets bullies have their way. A hero fights for law and order, so that everyone can live in prosperity and happiness. A hero slays monsters, clears ruins, and protects the innocent. You strive to be such a hero.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Gaining Levels</h2>\n<p>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.<br />With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d10 + 2 to your hit point maximum.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4>\n<p><em><strong>Action Surge.</strong></em> You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.<br />Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>3rd Level: 900 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Improved Critical.</em></strong> Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>4th Level: 2,700 XP</h4>\n<p><em><strong>Ability Score Improvement.</strong></em> Your Dexterity increases to 18, which has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Dexterity modifier becomes +4.</li>\n<li>Your attack bonus and your damage for Dexterity-based attacks, such as your longbow, increase by 1.</li>\n<li>Your modifier to Dexterity saving throws increases by 1.</li>\n<li>Your modifier to Dexterity-based skills increases by 1.</li>\n<li>While you wear light or no armor, your Armor Class increases by 1.</li>\n<li>Your initiative increases by 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>5th Level: 6,500 XP</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Extra Attack.</em></strong> Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make two attacks, instead of one, as part of taking that action.<br /><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your attack bonus increases by 1 for weapons you&rsquo;re proficient with.</li>\n<li>Your modifier for saving throws and skills you&rsquo;re proficient in (indicated by a checkmark) increases by 1.</li>\n<li>Because the modifier for your Perception skill increased, your passive Wisdom (Perception) score increases by 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Improving Your Armor</h4>\n<p>As you acquire treasure, you can buy better armor to improve your Armor Class.

They can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world.<br>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the centuries with stoic endurance. Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and committed in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness.<br><br>In the Forgotten Realms, your people are called gold dwarves. They have remote kingdoms in the south and typically keep their distance from human affairs. Their brethren are the shield dwarves of the north, who are strong, hardy, and accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. Years ago, you moved to that northern realm.<hr><strong>Male Dwarf Names:</strong> Adrik, Baern, Brottor, Dain, Darrak, Eberk, Einkil, Fargrim, Gardain, Harbek, Kildrak, Morgran, Orsik, Rurik, Taklinn, Thoradin, Tordek, Traubon, Travok, Veit, Vondal<br><br><strong>Female Dwarf Names:</strong> Amber, Artin, Bardryn, Dagnal, Diesa, Eldeth, Finellen, Gunnloda, Gurdis, Helja, Hlin, Kathra, Kristryd, Ilde, Liftrasa, Mardred, Riswynn, Sannl, Torbera, Torgga, Vistra<br><br><strong>Dwarf Clan Names:</strong> Battlehammer, Brawnanvil, Dankil, Frostbeard, Gorunn, Ironfist, Loderr, Strakeln, Torunn, Ungart<hr><h3>Cleric</h3>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest or temple servant, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.<br><br><strong><em>Divine Domain.</em></strong> You draw magic from a divine domain—a sphere of magical influence—associated with your deity. Your domain lets you have certain spells, such as bless and cure wounds, always prepared.<br><br>Your domain is Life, which is affiliated with many gods of good. Your god, Marthammor Duin, is the dwarf god of wanderers, travelers, and outcasts—those who move among strange lands and foreign peoples. Dwarves who honor him wear his holy symbol, a boot overlaid by an upright mace, on a necklace often made of silver and iron.<hr><h3>Background</h3>Trained as a soldier on the island of Mintarn, you traveled to Neverwinter as part of a mercenary company that serves as both army and city watch. You grew disillusioned with your fellow soldiers, who seem to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they’re supposed to protect. Everything came to a head recently, when you disobeyed an order and followed your conscience. You were suspended from active duty, though you kept your rank and your connection to the mercenaries.

With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d8 + 3 to your hit point maximum.<br><br>You gain access to more spells as you gain levels.

Both effects require you to use an action and present your holy symbol. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.<br><br><strong><em>Turn Undead.</em></strong> When you use Turn Undead, each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13). If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.<br><br>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action.<br><br><strong><em>Preserve Life.</em></strong> When you use Preserve Life, choose one or more creatures within 30 feet of you to heal, then distribute up to 10 hit points among them.

But they are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the world, the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.<br><br>When humans settle somewhere, they stay. They build cities to last for the ages and great kingdoms that can persist for centuries. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.<br><br>Human culture varies by region. In the Forgotten Realms, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature in the northwestern lands of Neverwinter are different from their counterparts in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east. Human physical characteristics vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of Neverwinter have every possible variation of coloration and features.<hr>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans have no truly typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly). Traditional names among different human cultures vary widely. You might be Haseid (Calishite), Kerri (Chondathan), Kosef (Damaran), Amafrey (Illuskan), So-Kehur (Mulan), Madislak (Rashemi), Mei (Shou), or Salazar (Turami).<hr><h3>Fighter</h3>Fighters are the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.<hr><h3>Background</h3>Your parents lived in the prosperous village of Thundertree, east of the city of Neverwinter and at the edge of the Neverwinter Wood. But when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, your parents fled, carrying you in your infancy. Your family drifted from village to village around the region, finding work as servants or laborers where they could.<br><br>You’ve spent the last few years in Neverwinter as a porter and laborer at the city’s bustling docks. But it’s clear to you and everyone around you that you are destined for much more. You stood up to an abusive ship captain once, so other dockworkers look up to you. Someday, you’ll come into your own. You’ll be a hero.<br><br><strong><em>Personal Goal: Drive Off the Dragon.</em></strong> The ruins of Thundertree call to you. Your family and their friends once lived in prosperity there, and now they’re reduced to menial labor. The ruins are haunted by ash zombies, and rumor has it a dragon has made its lair in the Old Tower, but those are problems a hero can solve. Slay the dragon, or drive it off, and you’ll prove—to yourself and everyone else—you’re a real hero, destined for greatness.<br><br><strong><em>Alignment: Lawful Good.</em></strong> A hero stands up to evil and never lets bullies have their way.

But when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, your parents fled, carrying you in your infancy. Your family drifted from village to village around the region, finding work as servants or laborers where they could.</p><p>   You’ve spent the last few years in Neverwinter as a porter and laborer at the city’s bustling docks. But it’s clear to you and everyone around you that you are destined for much more. You stood up to an abusive ship captain once, so other dockworkers look up to you. Someday, you’ll come into your own. You’ll be a hero.</p><p></p><p>Personal Goal: Drive Off the Dragon. The ruins of Thundertree call to you. Your family and their friends once lived in prosperity there, and now they’re reduced to menial labor. The ruins are haunted by ash zombies, and rumor has it a dragon has made its lair in the Old Tower, but those are problems a hero can solve. Slay the dragon, or drive it off, and you’ll prove—to yourself and everyone else—you’re a real hero, destined for greatness.</p><p></p><p>Alignment: Lawful Good. A hero stands up to evil and never lets bullies have their way. A hero fights for law and order, so that everyone can live in prosperity and happiness. A hero slays monsters, clears ruins, and protects the innocent. You strive to be such a hero.</p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Good","race":"Human","background":"Folk Hero","originalClass":"","xp":{"value":499,"min":0,"max":900,"pct":0},"appearance":"","trait":"When I set my mind to something, I follow through.

He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.</p><p>A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.</p><p>Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p><p>These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p><p>For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"25\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primal Instinct</span></span> <p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p><p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"26\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Life of Danger</span></span> <p>Not every member of the tribes deemed \"barbarians\" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p><p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"27\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Barbarian</span></span> <p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world.

Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee?

A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","quantity":1,"weight":25,"price":5,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":false,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"touch"},"uses":{"value":1,"max":1,"per":"charges","autoDestroy":false,"autoUse":true},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1d4","piercing"]],"versatile":"1"},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"dex","dc":13,"scaling":"flat"},"consumableType":"trinket"},"sort":2100000,"flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"items.html","source":"PHB","hash":"hunting%20trap_phb"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/green_14.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"SiAqI1SKZjSbHTDJ","name":"Pouch","type":"backpack","data":{"description":{"value":"<div>\n\t\t\t<div><i>Adventuring gear</i></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"flex w-100\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-4\">5 sp, 1 lb.</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-8 text-right\">  </div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p>A cloth or leather <i>pouch</i> can hold up to 20 <a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#sling%20bullet_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'items.html', 'phb', 'sling%20bullet_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >sling bullets</a> or 50 <a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#blowgun%20needle_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'items.html', 'phb', 'blowgun%20needle_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >blowgun needles</a>, among other things.

Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and committed in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness.<br><br>In the Forgotten Realms, your people are called gold dwarves. They have remote kingdoms in the south and typically keep their distance from human affairs. Their brethren are the shield dwarves of the north, who are strong, hardy, and accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain.

As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest or temple servant, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.<br><br><strong><em>Divine Domain.</em></strong> You draw magic from a divine domain—a sphere of magical influence—associated with your deity. Your domain lets you have certain spells, such as bless and cure wounds, always prepared.<br><br>Your domain is Life, which is affiliated with many gods of good. Your god, Marthammor Duin, is the dwarf god of wanderers, travelers, and outcasts—those who move among strange lands and foreign peoples. Dwarves who honor him wear his holy symbol, a boot overlaid by an upright mace, on a necklace often made of silver and iron.<hr><h3>Background</h3>Trained as a soldier on the island of Mintarn, you traveled to Neverwinter as part of a mercenary company that serves as both army and city watch. You grew disillusioned with your fellow soldiers, who seem to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they’re supposed to protect. Everything came to a head recently, when you disobeyed an order and followed your conscience. You were suspended from active duty, though you kept your rank and your connection to the mercenaries. Since then, you have devoted yourself to your deity.<br><br><em><strong>Personal Goal: Teach the Redbrands a Lesson.</strong></em> You’ve heard that Daran Edermath in the town of Phandalin is looking for people of courage and principle to teach some bullies a lesson. These thugs, the Redbrands, have been throwing their weight around in Phandalin, much as your compatriots did in Neverwinter. Putting a stop to their villainy is a worthy goal.<br><br><strong><em>Alignment: Neutral Good.</em></strong> Your conscience, not law and authority, will guide you to do the right thing. Power is meant to be used for the benefit of all, not to oppress the weak.<hr><h3>Gaining Levels</h3>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook. With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d8 + 3 to your hit point maximum.<br><br>You gain access to more spells as you gain levels. You can prepare a number of spells equal to your level + your Wisdom modifier, as shown in the Spellcasting Advancement table. You also gain more spell slots.<br><br><strong>Spellcasting Advancement</strong><br><div style=\"margin-left: 140px\">—Spell Slots per Spell Level—</div><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Level</strong></td><td><strong>Prepared Spells</strong></td><td><strong>1st</strong></td><td><strong>2nd</strong></td><td><strong>3rd</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table><br><h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4><strong><em>Channel Divinity.</em></strong> You can channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel one of two magical effects: Turn Undead or Preserve Life. Both effects require you to use an action and present your holy symbol. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.<br><br><strong><em>Turn Undead.</em></strong> When you use Turn Undead, each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13). If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.<br><br>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action.<br><br><strong><em>Preserve Life.</em></strong> When you use Preserve Life, choose one or more creatures within 30 feet of you to heal, then distribute up to 10 hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. At 3rd level, you can distribute 15 hit points, at 4th level 20, and at 5th level 25.<br><br><h4>3rd Level: 900 XP</h4><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> You can now prepare and cast 2nd-level spells.

Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an old dirt road.<br><br>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation.<br><br>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship, as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity.<hr>A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family names are often nicknames that stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through the generations.<br><br><strong>Male Names:</strong> Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich, Finnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn, Perrin, Reed, Roscoe, Wellby<br><br><strong>Female Names: </strong>Andry, Bree, Callie, Cora, Euphemia, Jillian, Kithri, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Nedda, Paela, Portia, Seraphina, Shaena, Trym, Vani, Verna<br><br><strong>Family Names:</strong> Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle, High-hill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage, Tosscobble, Underbough<hr><h3>Rogue</h3>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem.<hr><h3>Background</h3>The town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of an older settlement, vacant for five centuries until some hardy settlers set about rebuilding it some years back. Drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the nearby foothills, you came to Phandalin as well, not to earn a living, but to prey on those who struck it rich. You joined a gang calling itself the Redbrands and made some decent coin as a burglar, enforcer, or fence.<br><br>But you must have made an enemy among your fellow Redbrands. Someone set you up. On that person’s word, the head of the Redbrands—a wizard called Glasstaff—tried to have you killed. You escaped, barely alive and thanking Tymora, the goddess of good fortune, for your luck. You fled Phandalin, almost penniless and with only the tools of your trade to your name.<br><br><em><strong>Personal Goal:</strong></em> Get Your Revenge. Someone in the Redbrands nearly got you killed, and you sure would like to know who it was. And then you’d like to take your revenge—on that person, on Glasstaff, maybe on all the Redbrands. And you just got a tip that might help you: someone named Halia Thornton also has it out for the Redbrands. She lives in Phandalin, which means showing your face to the Redbrands who still want you dead.<br><br><em><strong>Alignment: Neutral.</strong></em> You tend to do whatever seems best at the time. Sure, you’ve done some things you’re not proud of, and you’re not personally committed to making the world a better place. But you have no interest in causing suffering or making things worse than they already are.<hr><h3>Gaining Levels</h3>As you adventure and overcome challenges, you gain experience points (XP), as explained in the rulebook.<br><br>With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die and add 1d8 + 1 to your hit point maximum.<br><br><h4>2nd Level: 300 XP</h4><strong><em>Cunning Action.</em></strong> Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly, so you can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.<br><br><h4>3rd Level: 900 XP</h4><strong><em>Second-Story Work.</em></strong> You gain the ability to climb faster than normal, so climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.<br><br><strong><em>Fast Hands.</em></strong> You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, take the Use an Object action, or use your thieves’ tools to try to disarm a trap or open a lock.<br><br><strong><em>Sneak Attack.</em></strong> You deal 2d6 damage with your Sneak Attack feature, instead of 1d6.<br><br><h4>4th Level: 2,700 XP</h4><strong><em>Ability Score Improvement.</em></strong> Your Dexterity increases to 18, which has the following effects:<br><ul><li>Your Dexterity modifier becomes +4.</li><li>Your attack bonus and your damage for Dexterity-based attacks, such as your shortsword and shortbow, increase by 1.</li><li>Your modifier to Dexterity saving throws increases by 1.</li><li>Your modifier to Dexterity-based skills increases by 1.</li><li>While you wear light or no armor, your Armor Class increases by 1.</li><li>Your initiative increases by 1.</li></ul><br><h4>5th Level: 6,500 XP</h4><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> Your proficiency bonus increases to +3, which has the following effects:<br><ul><li>Your attack bonus increases by 1 for weapons you’re proficient with.</li><li>Your modifier for saving throws and skills you’re proficient in (indicated by a checkmark) increases by 1. Your Expertise feature means your bonus for Stealth and the use of thieves’ tools instead each increase by 2.</li></ul><strong><em>Sneak Attack.</em></strong> You deal 3d6 damage with your Sneak Attack feature, instead of 2d6.<br><br><strong><em>Uncanny Dodge.</em></strong> When an attacker you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.<br><br><h4>Improving Your Armor</h4>As you acquire treasure, you can buy better armor to improve your Armor Class. The rulebook contains equipment, including armor.<br>\n<hr><section><p><strong>Personality Traits :</strong> </p><p>I never have a plan, but I’m great at making things up as I go along.

They can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world.<br>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the centuries with stoic endurance. Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and committed in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness.<br><br>In the Forgotten Realms, your people are called gold dwarves. They have remote kingdoms in the south and typically keep their distance from human affairs. Their brethren are the shield dwarves of the north, who are strong, hardy, and accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. Years ago, you moved to that northern realm.<hr><strong>Male Dwarf Names:</strong> Adrik, Baern, Brottor, Dain, Darrak, Eberk, Einkil, Fargrim, Gardain, Harbek, Kildrak, Morgran, Orsik, Rurik, Taklinn, Thoradin, Tordek, Traubon, Travok, Veit, Vondal<br><br><strong>Female Dwarf Names:</strong> Amber, Artin, Bardryn, Dagnal, Diesa, Eldeth, Finellen, Gunnloda, Gurdis, Helja, Hlin, Kathra, Kristryd, Ilde, Liftrasa, Mardred, Riswynn, Sannl, Torbera, Torgga, Vistra<br><br><strong>Dwarf Clan Names:</strong> Battlehammer, Brawnanvil, Dankil, Frostbeard, Gorunn, Ironfist, Loderr, Strakeln, Torunn, Ungart<hr><h3>Cleric</h3>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest or temple servant, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.<br><br><strong><em>Divine Domain.</em></strong> You draw magic from a divine domain—a sphere of magical influence—associated with your deity. Your domain lets you have certain spells, such as bless and cure wounds, always prepared.<br><br>Your domain is Life, which is affiliated with many gods of good. Your god, Marthammor Duin, is the dwarf god of wanderers, travelers, and outcasts—those who move among strange lands and foreign peoples. Dwarves who honor him wear his holy symbol, a boot overlaid by an upright mace, on a necklace often made of silver and iron.<hr><h3>Background</h3>Trained as a soldier on the island of Mintarn, you traveled to Neverwinter as part of a mercenary company that serves as both army and city watch. You grew disillusioned with your fellow soldiers, who seem to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they’re supposed to protect. Everything came to a head recently, when you disobeyed an order and followed your conscience. You were suspended from active duty, though you kept your rank and your connection to the mercenaries.

Both effects require you to use an action and present your holy symbol. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.<br><br><strong><em>Turn Undead.</em></strong> When you use Turn Undead, each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13). If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.<br><br>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
